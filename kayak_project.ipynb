       " 'i’m new to kayaking and wanted to get a boat my daughter age 7 and i can have fun with tried it out two weeks ago and i’m hooked we had a blast paddling around and i was able to get out further than i planned because i felt comfortable you do get a little wet so prepare for the weather conditions the boat is easy to manage in the water and out but after my trip i bought a cart i’m 5’3” 135lbs and was able after trial and error to get it on and off of my crosstrek and carry it over my head down the path to the shore the handle is misleading it’s really a dent to place your hand on each side the storage space is adequate i purchased a dry bag & carabiner a different paddle leash and emergency flip kit i can’t wait to get it into the water again',\n",
       " 'i loved this kayak for the price and i got it for an additional 20% off i was also looking for one that was rated to 300lbs and an open one sit on top for my 68 dad who was paranoid about sitting in a cockpit and not being able to get out incase it flipped so we purchased this pelican sentinel it did float and was great but for my father who is taller it sat way too high for him to balance in and as soon as he sat on it i was worried if he would look or twist his torso one way or another he found end up in the water we ended up returning this kayak and going with the perception sound 95 model because it sat lower had the cockpit that he wasnt thrilled about and he was able to balance much better pros to this model however are that it has a paddle with it',\n",
       " 'i now live right on the banks of the sassafras river of the upper cesapeake bay kayaking is universal here i needed to add another kayak for family when they visit this was ideal for my daughter’s use so i got it for her birthday last year i got another for my grandaughter’s 7th we are all in our own boats now',\n",
       " 'i like this boat for the price it is easy to paddle and light enough to carry alone but i wanted something to use on rivers and lakes and this isnt it the scupper holes for self bailing are so small that once you go through a wave the boat stays full of water for at least a full minute during that time the boat is to the gunnels in the water and has no stability even small class ii waves fill the boat and make it unpleasant for a cheap boat on a flat lake this is fine for a toy']"
