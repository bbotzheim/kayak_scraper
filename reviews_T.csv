"2nd kayak purchase from REI. Upgraded a Lifetime Lotus to the Pelican Sentinel for my 11 yr old. Tracks nicely, glides well, easy in/out, lots of storage behind seat. We are lake perimeter paddlers on quiet lakes for safety. No rough water, rivers, oceans, etc. My daughter stayed dry inside boat and liked the seat/backrest. Strictly leisurely paddlers. Perfect for the way we kayak. Only complaint is the paddle that comes with is flat-sided and has small driprings; we prefer a bit of a curved paddle head and will use a different paddle. Doesn't break our budget and is a great boat.","Very stable and comfortable. The high seat back is awesome. The center hatch is handy. Take the cover off and put in a 1-gal (8"") bucket from lowes and it's a handy compartment perfect for drinks and snacks. The cons are; the center hatch and side grips. The hatch opens to the entire inside cavity of the kayak so putting anything in there, it will be rolling around throughout the inside of the kayak. Thus the bucket from lowes. The side grips, or carrying handles, are shallow and don't go all the way through. You're doing a pinch grip trying to carry the kayak.","After picking up this kayak I was pretty disappointed right off the bat. The cargo hold in the back was claimed to be waterproof but water can easily flow in from the seating area, the styrofoam floatation wasn't secured in any manner (two pieces actually ended up flying out on the way home), the cargo hold hatch is extremely small given the huge amount of cargo space offered, and the entire kayak was filled with plastic shavings from the mfg process (you could seriously fill a gallon jug with how much shavings were in the boat). Once at the boat launch I tried using the skeg transport wheel and it ended up jamming within 10 seconds and subsequently did quite a number on the skeg before I noticed it was jammed. Negatives aside, on the water performance was semi-decent. Tracking could really be better but it is decently quick on the water which is a definite plus. All in all I was pretty bummed with the kayak as a whole given my intended use was more of a day-touring kayak, but it is also to my fault that I didnt pony up and spend more money for a proper touring kayak. Though every part of this kayak feels extremely cheap and there were many problems I had with the kayak (as stated above), for a strictly recreational kayak it does the job just fine and offers decent performance at a reasonable price. Side note- HUGE shoutout to Ray at Bellingham REI for helping me out through the return process and pointing me in the right direction for a proper touring kayak.",No reviews,"We have had other inflatable kayaks and this Advanced Elements Tandem is the very best on the market. It is easy to blow up, easy to maneuver, can be used by one person as well as two. It is sleek, fast, so well constructed and is so much fun to paddle and be in. We are always so proud to be paddling away in it!","We search high and low for a kayak in the $400 and less price range. Mainly looking for sit on tops. The carry handles are excellent, and I see this boat lasting a long time. Made in the USA, solid boat, not a 2 piece. It tracks straight and the paddle that comes with it is great. This kayak is very stable in the water, and easy to get back on if you decide to take a swim in the middle of the lake. Storage is great, but missing a dry bin. I bought a a dry storage plastic container and a zipper soft cooler and it fits great in the back.
Only negative is the seat. It can get a little sore on your lower back, but not having a seat with straps trumps this. I just re-adjust my seating position every once in awhile.
The kayak also handles shallow water very easily too. I could cost through 8-12"" of water easily and I weigh about 190 pounds.",I picked up the Wilderness Systems Aspire 105 on Friday and took it to Parvin State Park for its maiden voyage on Saturday. Very pleased with the comfort and handling of this yak. I am 6' and 275 lbs and had no issues entering or exiting the kayak. The skeg was great to help with tracking and it was much easier to paddle than my fishing kayak. It was also much lighter and easier to transport. My wife and I cruised around the lake for a couple of hours and the seat was very comfortable. Looking forward to my next chance to get it out on the water.,"This kayak is everything it's advertised to be. It's easy for me to get in and out of, VERY stable in the rapids, and has plenty of space to store whatever you need to take with you on your adventures. Would highly recommend.",I took out the boat today 8/16/19. I had a great time on the Kayak. It handles and maneuvers very well. Its an extremely stable kayak. You can lean into turns if you want and it still has great stability. Its not heavy and can be loaded on top of a car with one person. It handles choppy waves well. There was a second in the 90 minutes on the water that i questioned this boat. I love this kayak already after one use. I am sure you will as well,"Exceeded my expectations - I looked at over 10 other kayaks and settled on this one. Very stable, great seat on and off the boat, built in paddle holder, plenty of storage, moves quickly in the water. I have had it in bay, a lake and a few rivers and it handled great","I’m new to kayaking and I’m using this mostly in a bay on the ocean. First time out I had 1-3 ft waves and strong winds. I was very stable and did 3 miles in these conditions comfortably. I’m 6 ft and 215 lbs.
Great storage places (2 bottle holders, dry pocket, and big space in the back, and of course on top).
Only downside is that I can’t figure out how to get splashwater out of the cockpit. The drain plug is in an area where the water can’t get. So I now carry a small bilge pump.","I have been out three times since my purchase and so far I am very pleased. Most of the other pedal fishing kayaks are way more expensive and I was worried that the lesser price of this would mean a lesser product. That is not the case. This is especially true since I got this Kayak on memorial day sale 15% off! Here are my early observations.
Positives: The seat is very comfortable and easy to adjust. The tracks on the side were perfectly placed to add aftermarket rod holders. The sealed compartments are easy to access and had plenty of space. I was able to fit lunch, bottled water, wallet, keys, pliers, multi tool, headlamp, paracord phone etc. with room to spare. The front and back wells have more than enough room for an ice chest, a cargo crate, tackle box and a kayak cart. With all of that, there was still extra room. The pedal drive is quite and efficient. It is also easy to pull the pedal system into the shallow mode for beach etc. The rudder is easy to deploy and steer.
Negatives: 1. A few times I went through some weeds that got tangled in the prop. I pulled the pedal system up into shallow mode so I could access the prop. i was able to access it to pull the weeds but they didn't quite make the access port far enough back so it was kind of an awkward ""reach back"" into the access area to pull the weeds. 2. some of the screws were not tightened good from the factory and probably could have used some locktyte. First the front carry handle screw came off. More importantly though the four allen screws that hold the pedal drive down were slightly loose allowing the pin bracket to shift back after peddling a bit. this cause the drive pin to loosen. Fortunately I had my mult-itooll allen wrench with me and was able to tighten it back down. I have peddled several hours since then with no more problems. 3. The scuppers in the main passenger area are low to the water and will let water in as soon as you sit down. If you don't want wet feet, get scupper plugs right away! The cargo area scuppers do not have this same problem. 4. The molded in rod holders are basically useless. They are too shallow and too wide so fishing poles just flop around in them. I will have to install some aftermarket holders.
Even though the negative list looks longer than the positives, they really are all just minor quirks that don't really take away from the overall value and performance. I peddled and fished all three days this weekend and absolutely love this thing. I am already thinking of sneaking away from work for some more!",This is the second Oru I have. I purchased the original and have taken over 100 trips with it. So I can attest they are well built and can handle hitting logs and bottom scraping. This new design is even easier to assemble and the roomy cockpit is fantastic with storage behind the seat and in front of your feet. Initially it feels a bit wobbly since you can't brace your knees on the sides. Tracking is not particularly good but being able to put it in a trunk and be in the water in 5 minutes is well worth it.,"I am 62 years old, 5’2”, 200lb woman. This kayak is great. Getting it on top of my SUV was more than I could do, so I bought a trailer. I take this everywhere. i can fit a small cooler below my feet and picnic in the middle of the lake. There is even room for my 4 yr old grandson with plenty of room to paddle. Whether for an afternoon or all day, this is great.","I looked a long long time, and with the help of the awesome REI guys at two different stores, finally selected this sweetie as my second kayak. I had the wonderful Tarpon 100, but now that I just turned 60, I was finding that I was putting off going out because it was getting too heavy and awkward (can’t grab and lift it from the slides since it’s a sit-on-top model) to easily hoist on top of my RAV4 (I used to slide it easily on my Prius). A hullavator may be in my future so I can go out well into my 80s, but for now that was out of range! So i was looking for something beautiful but much lighter and easier to handle on my own, and wow this kayak fits the bill. I can easily lift it and with the SweetRoll rack attachment I got, it slides up and on the car like a dream. The awesome REI staff showed me how to load and tie it down when that was seeming too confusing, and one lesson was all it took! I take it out all the time now, and every time I load and unload it, I cant help but smile at how wonderfully light it is! And it glides like a dream and did i mention how pretty it is?? I love, love, love it!",No reviews,"I recently purchased the Perception Pescador 12.0 ft from REI. This company was good to deal with in that I received my kayak in about 10 days with seamless delivery. The kayak is just what I was looking for. It tracks well and glides across the water. It is stable and is easy to get on and maneuver. I am 5’2 and 63 years old. Can I lift this kayak? No. Can I pull it into my boathouse? Yes. I live on a large lake and use my kayak for recreational use at least 2 hours daily during warmer weather. If you are looking for a sit-on top kayak for recreational purposes, this is a great one!","I kayaked in the 80’s, and now re-entering the sport. There are so many specialized kayaks now it is hard to make a decision on which one to buy. I spent months researching brands from US, Canada and Europe. I read hundreds of reviews and tech articles, watched dozens of YouTube videos and then asked myself what I planned to do with my kayak. Ultimately I wanted a versatile kayak to handle lakes, rivers and some coastal action. Also, I want to do some camping out of it. I narrowed my list to the Dagger Stratos 14.5L and Wilderness Systems Tsunami 14.5. 14.5 feet is the most I can handle loading and unloading from my truck solo, and the longest kayak I felt comfortable taking on a moving river. The Stratos 14.5L in red won primarily because of the built-in skeg, and the low seat back needed when using a spray skirt. Red kayaks are faster:) I am 6’-0”, 225 lbs. and wear 10.5 size shoe. I have no issues entering or exiting the Stratos. On a lake with a wind, the skeg really makes a big difference. When wind cocking occurs, drop the skeg, get on course, and start paddling. The outside of the kayak has good, retractable T-handles for lifting each end, and the deck rigging is sturdy. The skeg control is located on the right side of cockpit and easy to access. The rubber hatch covers seal tightly and have not leaked yet. Inside are adjustable foot rests that can be adjusted while sitting in the boat. The thigh braces are adjustable with a screwdriver. Between your legs there is a small console to strap a water bottle to. The seat is comfortable but I can’t keep the backrest adjusted. The straps loosen in the buckles. I have been on large & small lakes with the kayak 8 times since I purchased it a few months ago. I am happy with the purchase and the backrest losing adjustment is the only issue. I contacted Dagger and they offered a few suggestions. If this doesn’t correct it then they said they would send a new seat back or parts to correct it. Buying a kayak comes down to compromises. How are you going to transport it? How are you going to load/unload? What type of water do you plan to paddle (lake, river, ocean)? What features do you want? How much do you want to spend? Remember to budget $300-$400 for a good PFD and paddle. I went with Astral and Werner, respectively. A cheap, poorly fitting PFD will inhibit your movement and chafe. A cheap, heavy paddle with flexing blades will burn more energy when paddling. Get the paddle matched for your height and the 25.5” width of the Stratos. Also, there are high-angle and low-angle paddles. I would start with a low-angle and buy a high-angle for a spare later. This way you will have both with you on the boat and can choose the one appropriate for the moment.","I am 6ft tall with 34 inseam and size 14 feet. I fit comfortably,but if I was taller maybe not.Great hull design.Good speed for a boat of this length.Boats plastic feels more rigid than the Sojourn 146. the pressfit hatch's are interesting,but will have too see how they do in winter conditions.On concern is the Plastic handle attachments front and rear.{should have used stainless] and the molded in Nubbin on the front deck.If the Nubbin gets broken off you will have a major issue.I am 65 years old and removed the rudder and foot braces for weight savings and got the boat down to 42lbs.I do overnights and the 14 holds Plenty of gear.A Mountain trails cot will fit in the front.Definitely would recommend the boat.",I have always liked the idea of moving water paddling and twisty turny rivers. I tried this Malibu 11.5 on a familiar creek and found that it is rather nice and a little more heavier than my Scrambler but not as easy to handle as the Scrambler but rather a whole new animal that was very hard to maneuver through moving water but yet I completed my trip a little faster than normal. It is a nice looking boat and I guess I need to get used to it. Other than the maneuvering issue I found that I kept pinching my fingers on the seat back hook in point but other than that it was an okay trip,No reviews,"I recently purchased this kayak to do a little fishing with my young son and still be able to pack it up and travel with it. I have two other inflatable single person kayaks with closed cockpits. So far I have been out on Lake Erie and a large pond a few times. The kayak is lightweight, and stable. It inflates very quickly with the pump. It is nice that there are only three inflation ports and they are all the same so you dont have to switch adaptors as I need to with my other inflartable kayaks. It is suseptible to being blown around a bit in stronger winds because of the height and girth of the kayak. The seats are very comfortable and adjustable in terms of placement within the kayak. If you are really into fishing the Scotty mounts are a great addition. It would be nice to have a cleat accessory to mount in the Scotty mount to be able to tie off a rope or anchor. I ended up adding a modified one right into the Scotty mount. The kayak dries very quickly when taken out of the water, deflates quickly and packs back into the wonderful backpack bag. I recommend this kayak highly.","As a volunteer nature guide, I needed a kayak that was comfortable, relatively light, and fast enough to corral other paddlers. The Eddyline Skylark meets these needs. The seat is comfortable for 8 hours of paddling. The kayak is light enough to be easily car-topped and stored by one retiree. The boat tracks well and enables me to rapidly move around in a group of paddlers in the nature programs. The bonus is that it is a gorgeous kayak. I receive many compliments and young kayakers often ask to sit in it. While the kayak is still new, thus far I am very pleased with the design, performance, and comfort of the Eddyline Skylark.",This is the second kayak we own by same company. Pleased with quality and reliability. We have used this one on lakes and gentle rivers. Would recommend a cart if entry point is a distance. Easy to re-enter if tipped over. Drains well. We both have back issues and have found the seats to be very comfortable and adjustable. Tracks well even when using with a single paddler. Love the Sit-on-Top style for warmth of sun and cooling water spray.,I bought this kayak based on friends recommendations and some of the online reviews. I have serious back problems due to a work injury so I wasn’t even sure if I could go paddling any longer. However with the a few seat adjustments this kayak allowed me to paddle on a small lake for a couple of hours without much difficulty. The kayak tracks well for a shorter model although I’m not sure how it would be in the ocean. I prefer to stick to lakes and ponds myself. It’s a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Console is a nice addition but cup holders aren’t deep enough for a canteen or water bottle. I’m really happy with my choice.,No reviews,No reviews,No reviews,No reviews,"We were loving our kayak for the first year. I could take my kids out on the lakes of Seattle, transporting everything in my little hatchback. One year after purchase (after maybe 8 outings) we noticed it was leaking air. There was a tear in the bladder right where it attached to the valve. Since it's not a flat area patching didn't work. No replacement bladders available from aquaglide. Luckily REI has amazing customer service for a return. Ambivalent about buying another Aquaglide or other inflatable kayak. The convenience was great, but longevity makes me concerned.","We are a couple of women who bought these kayaks to replace the Sky 10's that were too wide. These fit perfectly. They are *very* fast and are reasonably stable. We have better control over them since they are more narrow and we are small. One retailer let us know we should be 5'9"" or less, which we are. It is better to be slender since they are about 24"" in diameter. They only weigh 35 lbs and are easy to handle. Nice storage areas and guaranteed not to sink. We've tested that aspect in these kayaks as well as the Sky 10's and sure enough, no matter how much water they get in them or how long they stay upside-down or sideways, the Eddylines do not sink.","Fine boat, one of the best I've paddled in more than 10 years. Very good primary and secondary stability make it suitable for most paddlers after they've had just a bit of experience. Excellent build quality and ergonomics. I'm not that large (5-11, 205 lbs) but preferred the deck height (13 inches) of the 17 to accommodate my aging frame for easier entry/exit. No major quibbles, but the day hatch pod limits leg space (Delta might have used a rubber bag rather than hard plastic) and I wish REI stocked the skeg version of the boat.","I have put over 150 miles on this kayak since purchasing and 40 miles were a 4 day trip to Shoshone Lake in Yellowstone National Park. Coming from a Wilderness systems Tsunami 145 to this boat is a dream. Light, fast and can pack the kitchen sink for multi day trips. Handled all my camping gear, camera equipment, tripod, chair with room to spare. Very stable boat in any type of conditions and handles anything you throw at it in terms of wind and weather.
Impressive speed loaded or unload. With a full load I was averaging 3.1-3.4mph with mild headwind. Rudder system works well although it was a bit still when brand new. Day hatch saves the day for snacks, GPS, and other goodies. My only complaint is the hatches which are sometimes hard to snap on. I now clean them constantly which helps a bunch as it would for any hatch. Nice large hatch openings make packing larger items a breeze.
I labored for a couple years purchasing the Delta 15.5 GT and have not looked back. If you plan to spend some time on lakes and larger rivers especially multi-day camping, this is you puppy!",Very stable. Can reach in my cooler without any problem. Can stand on this boat. Was a little noisy in the water. Scupper plugs may fix this.,"Where do I start? This boat is fantastic! Easy to maneuver when skeg is up and tracks like a dream when it is down and on open water. I'm out every weekend in this thing and I couldn't be more pleased with it's comfort and handling. Storage is adequate for a boat this size, so no complaints there. Overall, a great boat for those who like to cruise rivers and lakes of all sizes.","I got the Packlite because I thought it would make a certain kind of Adirondack backpacking more interesting, and I haven't been disappointed. I use it mostly as a packraft that fits into a large backpack, and I use it to get to secluded campsites where dragging a canoe or kayak would be impossible. It's opened up a world of backcountry camping for me.
One of my favorite ways to use it is to load it into a backpack, and hike along a trail upstream, then float back downstream. There are lots of places in the Adirondacks where this is possible. It makes the planning part of the trip more interesting, too.
I would NOT bring it into the ocean, or across an open lake that's wind-whipped or even really breezy. I think that would be a frustrating paddle. But for a certain niche use, there's nothing like it (especially for the price).
I haven't had any trouble with tears after three years of ownership. I've floated down extremely shallow, rocky streams with no problem.",No reviews,No reviews,No reviews,No reviews,No reviews,No reviews,"My fiancée and I bought two of these a couple months ago. I’m 6’4” 230lbs, and can say I’m completely comfortable paddling for hours. Had a small bulkhead leak (mentioned in a previous review), far easier to give it a dab of silicone than start a factory warranty claim for the same fix. The compartment lids are a bit wonky, but I appreciate the extra lip on the seal once they’re closed. Have used these in lakes, ponds, Block Island and Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge and they handled choppy saltwater very well and very stable!",I love this kayak. Tracks nicely. Lots of storage. Compfortable fit. Easy load and unload. I'm 5'4 130lbs and feel better in this one over my 10.5 ft. Feels like I could paddle many more hours more comfortably and would be great for some multiple days trips.,"Having paddled all sorts of1 3-14 1/2' touring boats for 2 years rented from an outfitter, I was looking for the ""one boat to rule them all."" For me the Eddyline Sitka LT is that boat. Being a new boat this year, there was no place I could go to even sit in one much less demo. But I traveled around to demo all else I was interested in (Current Designs Vision, Delta 14, Hurricane Sojourn, and demoed boats I had been paddling-- Castine 140, Tsunami 140 etc as comparison. I like the Delta 14 --another light weight, thermoformed (hard plastic) boat the best of those demoed but found the shape and size of the keyhole cockpit too restrictive for my legs on entry/exit and while paddling. Also going as fast as I could...which was not all that fast. Verdict on Delta14-- really beautiful build but ""a bit of a barge"" with great storage. Eddyline has the Denali for the ""big guys"" 200+ lbs.(rebranded as Sitka XT) and the Samba (now the Sitka ST) for small people about 130lbs and less but the new Sitka LT, is the medium/Goldilocks/just right I have been looking for as a fun-to-paddle, playful kayak for an M/L woman. I took a leap of faith ordering it for delivery to an REI store along with the Thule Hullavator I would need to cartop it on my SUV by myself. Here in NJ we have medium to larger lakes, long interior rivers like the Delaware, tidal estuaries and ocean bays. I also take trips to Chesapeake Bay and the Carolinas. I searched for a 14 ft-(give or take 1/2 ft. )kayak that could handle sea kayaking, yet not be too long for our rivers. I was also looking forward to consistently paddle the same boat for skill building.
Also as a 5'6"" female of a certain age, I knew my tricky shoulder and knee would require a lighter weight boat for loading. I looked at all the thermoform (Hard Plastic) boats I could find. The websites all say 49 lb for Sitka LT but the tag said 47Lb and so do the reps' videos online. Based on lifting it, I think it is 47 lbs. The cockpit is 1/2"" wider and 1.2"" longer and the deck height is 1/2"" more, than Delta 14 but it is the U-shape keyhole that makes it easier to get in and out of the boat. The seat is very supportive/comfortable to my long torso with side hip padding built in and a nice angle for leg comfort. There are thigh pads under the deck for bracing.( I will be adding some foam padding there to get a better fit/contact.) I move up the seat for my short legs-- there are enough adjustments for someone 6- 6'2"" to paddle this. This boat is 23.5"" wide and the first boat that did not stress my shorter arms-- I developed a ""high angle"" paddling style out of necessity-- the lower and narrower deck-- than the similar length Old Towns and Wilderness boats-- was a real relief and much more fun.
Primary/initial stability is less than Castine and Tsunami but I learned quickly how to get in/get going. Secondary stability is awesome. Last night doing Jleans and bracing in a class, I got up on edges and leaned with the best of them and Yep, the guys in the Tsunami and the Castine capsized. SitkaLT held firm! The fast, shallow V shaped hull is efficient, such fun to paddle, nimble as can be, with a sliding skeg so no rudder drag and controls to deal with yet extra help tracking in strong winds. Tracks straight and does not have the weather cocking problems of the Soujourns or the rudder controls of the Delta. Sitka LT is also the fastest boat of it's size I have paddled to date. I don't know if she can keep up with the 17' sea kayaks others bring on our ocean trips, but I anticipate a vast improvement.
In addition to being so much fun, this is one beautiful boat with the ""red pearl"" paint and beautiful styling.
for camping items.","I really want to love this kayak, because there's literally nothing like it on the market, but two months after purchasing it, and shipping it back to Oru for service multiple times, we still don't have a functional boat, and customer service is very slow to respond to inquiries.
Like James' review, we've had two floorboards broken in shipping, as well as other shipping damage. We've also been plagued by slipping G-hooks, the hardware that hooks up the seatbacks and footrests. Our first kayak they didn't hold any tension whatsoever - they immediately slipped. Oru replaced the g-hooks, but the floorboards were damaged in shipping when they sent it back to us, and the slippage wasn't fixed.
Oru eventually sent us a brand new boat, but it exhibited the same problems -- floorboards severely damaged in shipping, and the g-hooks *still* slipped. This time the slippage resulted in damaging the stabilizer bar, which is immediately behind the front seat. That's three times we've excitedly unpacked a Haven only to be immediately disappointed.
More disturbing, each time the metal parts have *bent*. I've never seen any slippage on the regular nylon buckles used in their other kayaks - I don't think these metal parts were intended to be used for load-bearing applications. They're very popular on backpacks and messenger bags for closing pockets and flaps, but they don't seem to hold up under load.
This is a theoretically wonderful boat, but it's been marred manufacturing quality issues and well-meaning but ineffective and slow customer support.
Hopefully they can iron out the material and shipping problems soon.",No reviews,"I had spent nearly $500 on a fishing kayak without testing it first. Big mistake, after trying out the NRS Star I was sold and couldn’t wait to buy. Light, easy to inflate, comfortable, fast. First time out water was really choppy and I felt really confident. Highly recommend this item",No reviews,No reviews,I purchased this boat 2 years ago and of the 4 yak's I own I use this one the most.,No reviews,"The boat has all the shortcomings you'll find other people talking about and all the convenience, too. I've been on one 2 night camping trip with it, and taken it out several times on lakes. I plan on taking it for more camping trips, so you know where it isn't great isn't that bad.
For some reference, I'm a slightly experienced amateur paddler. 6'2"" and pretty skinny (with plenty of room for taller or shorter or less skinny people). I've supplemented with a Werner Camano paddle, NRS float bags, a Snap Dragon neoprene spray skirt (large deck size!), and a Skwoosh seat pad. These things all fit the boat well!
Cons: - The seat is horribly uncomfortable. I'm still trying to find the right fix for this for my skinny rear end. Buy an aftermarket seat of some kind! - The seat back is high enough you may need to get a different PFD if you already have one. I lucked out that mine has a plenty high area for seat backs. Others who have tried the boat have not been so lucky. - Not great for shy people. You absolutely WILL get a small crowd if you set this boat up in public. - No day hatch. I'm getting better at placing stuff between the knees and on the bow, but I'd love a day hatch. - The bow doesn't make a proper V in the water and thus doesn't really ""cut"" the water. From what I can tell this is not really affecting speed or ability to coast too much, depending on load. Pretty noticeable sound/visual disturbance. Considering the engineering masterpiece the rest of the boat is, this baffles me a bit. - It's hard not to feel slightly nervous every time you see a rock, even if I already know it's fine. The psychology of paddling a political sign boat in the ocean is interesting. - Without float bags the boat takes on a TON of water when flipping. It won't sink on you, but you're probably going to have to bilge it before you attempt a self rescue. - Rear deck lines don't give a lot of confidence - I wouldn't tie anything heavy or important down back there.
Pros: - It fits in a small car. I think I could get two in my hatchback! - Carrying it to the water (assembled or not) is at least 5x easier than a rigid boat. - Conversation starter. People at marinas especially love to ask about it. - Holds so much gear. I'd say 50-100% more than a comparable rigid sea kayak. And so easy to load and unload. - Self rescues are so easy for me (due to how light the boat is) I don't even need to setup a paddle float. Apparently a cowboy rescue is even easier, though I haven't attempted. A heel hook rescue might be a bit of a lost cause, though. - The idea of being able to fly with the boat. Haven't done it (yet) but just knowing I can for my next vacation is great.","Just arrived and want to clarify that it does have the screw in skeg. You take the plate off the screw (where you keep it so as not to lose it) and put it in the slot and then slide the skeg in the slot and then slide the plate to align with the phillips head screw in the skeg. Not rocket science, but something you want to be careful with so as to not lose the screw or plate, and not something you want to switch around a lot while out. And remember the screwdriver.
Also both the online manual and the one that ships with the kayak is missing the second part of step 10 and first part of step 11. (footrest/skeg install). (It doesn't look like anything too important.)
Kayak itself is impressive. Hope to update review after some use.","I bought this kayak to replace an older kayak that I loved but was just too heavy to put on the car's roof racks by myself and was therefore limiting my kayaking options. This kayak is very light and solved my problem, but I what I was not expecting was all the other advantages that came with it. It is so comfortable that I can paddle endlessly without the need of stopping to stretch, and it tracks beautifully. It has great quality in every detail, including the hatches, the paddle holders, the handles... I kayak with my Golden Retriever and it is very stable and comfortable with both of us on it. In summary, I am very happy with my purchase.","Do not let the small 12'3"" size of this boat scare you, it is super stable, a dream to paddle, it's low-profile cuts through the wind like no other making it the best boat out there fish from. This boat shines in small ponds and in lakes but is also comfortable and safe to use in larger bodies of water such as Long Island Sound. The new seat system provides a full day of comfort. The optional silent pad accessory allows you to store your paddle quietly without any scratching or scraping sounds making this a deadly fishing machine.
This boat was also put to use in rescue recovery operations for emergency services its small size and 86 pounds allows it to be easily launched in bodies of water that a normal boat or inflatable cannot be placed in. Also with the removable flex pod that comes standard with the boat you can place a quality down scan/side scan sonar fish finder, transducer and battery all in and under the Pod and take it out at the end of the day for security purposes. An example of the stability of the boat can be shown where I was able to hang a 200 pound submersible training dummy off the side of the boat paddle out to spot on the body of water and sink the training dummy for locating purposes. This boat was able to run grid pattern searches to locate the victim on a very windy day tracking true and straight even with the wind.
I liked this boat so much I purchased the second one for the purpose of taking veterans with PTSD kayak fishing our veterans deserve the best and this is it.","One of the easiest and more effortless paddling kayaks on the market. Offers great back support as well as spacious storage, in my opinion there is not a better fishing kayak","Really good quality, fun to use, will last a long time. I use on river runs and have done salt water fishing in gulf. Seats are comfortable and foot rests are good height. Recommend buying a skirt if you take out where waves are",No reviews,First kayak. Not much to judge this against but it is awesome. Comfortable and so much fun. Nothing I would change,No reviews,"After countless hours searching through reviews, online sales, and second-hand websites, I was lucky enough to come across the Pescador Pro 12 at REI, Inc. It was on sale for a little more than $700; down from a retail price of $829. I knew I wanted a raised, folding mesh seat, foot pegs instead of molded foot braces, and the ability to add a rudder at some point in the future ( I will be adding a converted weedeater motor soon). This kayak had all of that and at 65lbs, it was much lighter than other offerings I saw. Let me stress this thing is a tank, it just doesn't weigh like one. First impressions... the Scotty gear tracks are convenient and sturdy and are placed well to be reachable. Far enough forward that I never felt the need to move my rod holders to keep from hitting them with my paddle (you'll want a 240cm to 250cm paddle for this bad boy). My milk crate fit well in the rear tank well with room for a small cooler. The molded-in rod holders behind the seat aren't the greatest (too big) but will serve as an attachment point for my motor bracket nicely. There are no additional rod holders behind the seat. I've never understood putting them back there anyway.... Can't really spin around in a kayak to get to them easily. small center console leaves room for standing (yes, I stood in it first time out!) and can hold small items like pliers or your depthfinder setup, if you go that route. There is no foam or rubber gasket on center console hatch. FYI. My first outing was the Neuse River near Smithfield. The current was running pretty good, but not flood fast. The boat tracked very well; it was easy to maintain a straight line even going upstream. Just a few strokes had me moving at a decent clip. Even towed my son in his 10 footer without working too hard. The seat was exactly what I had hoped for... To be a non-issue. Never even thought about fanny fatigue, although we were only out for about two hours. I am completely happy with my decision to go with the Perception Pescador Pro 12 in Moss Green from REI.","Overall a nice kayak with one pretty big problem. I have kayaked peacefully for over five years with other kayaks. The first time I took this one out it was on totally calm salt water. At one point I quickly turned around to look behind me. Splash, the kayak flipped and I was in the water. In five years I had never experienced kayak instability. Since then I have confirmed this craft is easily tipped. The salt water probably makes this worse since you float higher on the water.","I purchased this model over 20 years ago & continue to use it. Basic design & components have changed very little. Another review mentions lack of cupholders & there were none back then either! Very efficient as you paddle, I found that during longer paddles with others, that I/we were able to travel with less effort than others. Great storage in and on top for longer trips. A bit heavy (but great for a tandem), but that is the cost of having such great storage. I always use padded bottom & back rests that I've purchased from other sources. I love the ability to talk/hear with another paddler. Highly recommend!","Owned for a year now and I love it. Tracks great, excellent weight for the size, and very comfy. Lots of room for gear. I am 5' 10"", 200 pounds, and I fit perfectly.",No reviews
"I’m new to kayaking and wanted to get a boat my daughter (age 7) and I can have fun with. Tried it out two weeks ago and I’m hooked. We had a blast paddling around and I was able to get out further than I planned because I felt comfortable. You do get a little wet so prepare for the weather/conditions. The boat is easy to manage in the water and out but after my trip I bought a cart. I’m 5’3” 135lbs and was able (after trial and error) to get it on and off of my Crosstrek and carry it over my head down the path to the shore. The handle is misleading. It’s really a dent to place your hand on each side. The storage space is adequate. I purchased a dry bag & carabiner, a different paddle, leash, and emergency flip kit. I can’t wait to get it into the water again.","This is a great little recreational kayak. We have gone kayaking every week since we got them. It does take two people to carry but with the handles at the front and rear, we carry both kayaks at a time . Great fun on the water.","I love my Kayak; but while transporting it I lost the rear hatch cover. My fault for not removing it prior to driving but I reached out to Lifetime expecting to pay a ridiculous price for such a little part, but, to my surprise the CSR decided to give me the warranty replacement part. This little act right here has guaranteed me as a lifetime brand customer.",,"We bought it about 3 weeks ago. We took it on water about six times, always in Puget Sound. It took me 15 minutes to inflate it the first time and the air is still holding. It is very stable in the water and holds direction great for an inflatable kayak. We love it! We have a tandem and two of us are very comfortable in the boat. We have not loaded it with any equipment yet. I also love the fact that it can be converted into a single boat by moving the seat. It is nice to go out by myself. We initially considered buying a sit-on rigid kayak, but we're worried that we would not be able to carry it. This boat is lighter and very easy to handle.","Borrowed this from a friend near the intracoastal waterway in NC. In order to get from the dock to a bird sanctuary - we had to cross the intracoastal. No problem. This little kayak handled wave after wave and hard paddling for hours - took on almost no water and traveled true and straight. Carries a cooler on the back, but you will have to figure out what to do with a waterproof bag - we affixed ours to the front with carbingers. The seat is a bit painful after 6 hours on the water, but I would rather have that then a seat which could break and leave me without support. All in all, a great kayak. We will be buying two of these this weekend while on sale!",I researched this kayak .. Read all the reviews. I love it. Glides so nice thru the water. The skeg comes down easily. It is heavier than my previous kayak. But I LOVE this one.,I was looking for a lightweight and stable kayak just for recreation. This kayak is lightweight however I dont feel it is that stable. My cheap kayak I had before felt more stable. I have only been out twice so far but would probably not go out if there were waves of any size. It also get water inside when i use it.,"We're 50+ and this kayak is easy to move, store, lift and carry. Fast on the water, turns on a dime and yet remains stable in choppy water. So far we've taken it on open lakes but we've enjoyed the responsiveness so much we're planning river trips with confidence. Bungees are handy for storage and temporary paddle handling. Front and rear storage compartments are NOT watertight. But the front, round storage is a size we think we can get a gasket for to make it watertight - it is large enough to hold keys, smartphone glasses and wallet. Rear storage is big enough for a day/overnight pack (we recommend a watertight pack) for camping trips. The storage is sealed off by a foam ballast behind the seat that might need an extra line of caulk if you want it more water resistant. Seat is the best I've seen and comfortable, including lower lumbar support and is adjustable - both tilt and height. Footrests are good and easily adjustable, even on the water with a little balance act. Deck bottle holder is on the smaller size but is a real, deep holder. Interior bottle holder is larger and flexible to fit odd-sized/shaped bottles. Drain plug only drains back compartment, not the entire kayak. Carry handles are super easy to use and the attachment mechanism is such you can add a security cable to lock the kayak up. Knee pads are light, but comfortable. Cockpit has a good molded-round edge to accept deck covers for both less transportation winds and less water in your lap covers. The combination of seat, footrests and kneepads work synergistically for comfortable casual paddling or ""beat the lightning off the lake"" faster paddling styles - both elbow at 90 degrees when paddling or hands shoulder width apart styles. Weight capacity is sufficient for us to carry additional gear.","I bought a Pelican Maverick Memorial Day w/end, but after using it in a creek with lots of shallow spots, I got very tired of crawling out of it to walk it to deeper water. I did some research, and found that a sit on top would be much easier to get in & out. I also wanted one with a higher weight capacity, and to not roll as easily. The Pescador Pro fit my needs! I even put a 40lb trolling motor on it. It has the leg room I need, being 6'4"", and the seat is comfortable. Unfortunately, the stitching on the seat straps broke on the third time out! Can't sit in it without them. Overall, it's a very sturdy kayak, and I'm quite happy with it.",,I took this boat out last weekend for the first time. I am 69 years old and a cancer survivor on treatment so I was concerned about the weight which is listed as 85 lbs. I found that I was able to get it into my truck single handedly as well as launch it and retrieve it. Once I had it in the water I was very impressed with how easy it was to deploy the peddle drive and rudder. Once deployed it handled really well and it was also easy to get peddle and rudder in a zero draft position to bring it back to shore. Seat was comfortable and sturdy. Once back on on shore it is easy to release the seat and the drive mechanism to lighten it for loading. I'm not sure I have the right paddle. It seems to dump a lot of water on me and may need to be longer. That's why I like REI. I know that they will allow me to exchange it if I decide to do so. Very pleased with this purchase.,"This is super great kayak for its purpose, which is leisurely kayaking around a lake or slow moving river. You can spread out, sit cross legged, have a picnic, even fit a small passenger. The folding-unfolding is pretty easy and once folded it fits in the trunk of a car or back seat. BUT if you want to seriously kayak I would recommend the original Oru Bay kayak because your legs won't get totally wet and your arms won't keep banging on the sides because it's so wide. Those are the two negative issues I have with the Beach. I already own the Bay and thought this would be great as a 2nd one for friends, but I'm returning it and maybe getting a 2nd Bay because it's a better all-purpose kayak. But I still give the Beach 5 Stars because, for what it is, it's fantastic.",I would buy this boat over again in a heartbeat. I paddle mainly slow moving rivers and lakes. Very stable and tracks well. Enough room to have my 40lbs dog who paces up front. Highly recommend.,"The Delta 12.10 is light, glides well, comfortable, and is a joy to paddle. This is my first Delta and I am very impressed with their quality. Since I couldn’t see it in person before purchase, I was concerned about the seat, but that was all for not since it’s highly adjustable and very comfortable. The fore and aft hatches are quite large and the day hatch is much larger than I was expecting and easy to open. There is a metal locking point just behind the seat that isn't shown in the picture. It's great for locking down the boat if needed. I look forward to many days on the water and I highly recommend this kayak.",,"They've redesigned the boat. 2017 was a fantastic boat, this pescador is now 4.5 inches wider-- and as physics will dictate slower. Also it is harder for younger paddlers to handle the wider boat. They've even redesigned the back of the boat to no longer be streamline, and creates more turbulence. Look for a used '17, or a different brand.","I purchased this boat over a year ago and have been happy with it. I am 5'11"", 190 and the boat fits me well. I have been in some big water with 50 pounds of gear on board and used it on overnight and multi-day trips and the boat is easy to handle in rough water and in the wind.
The area in front of the cockpit is large and helps with a roll, but I do have a really steep paddling angle and sometimes hit the shell of the boat with my knuckles. All-in-all, a good, stable and sturdy boat for camping and covering miles, I can do about 12-15 comfortably and 20 if needed in a day.","Kayak designs are always a compromise, I have owned a roto CD Vision boat for many years - at 14 feet I expected a very similar boat, the Delta 14 is a lot slower, but feels more efficient, I think the day hatch needs a 'lock down' feature and the hatch gaskets do leak - just a tad - I guess that's why they make dry bags. I have had the Delta 14 in really rough water and it does well even in 4 foot swells - I would be confident of this boat in ocean waters. I do like the rudder set-up. folks debate if a 14 foot kayak needs a rudder - yes, in rough water and winds it does. It's a good boat and one can always critique any product. It's a good steady kayak and as stated, has excellent fit and finish.","I was eager to buy this model assuming it was as good as the Scrambler model (which has been discontinued) if not better. The built-in seat is nice as is the small storage compartment but the handling of it was a big disappointment.It did not track well at all, veering constantly to the left, worsening with wavy conditions.",,"After months of studying reviews and researching inflatable kayaks I finally decided to purchase the Aquaglide Blackfoot Kayak. I feel it does live up to what it claims and although I only used it twice before it was stollen I can attest to durability and versitility. In my opinion the keel (removable) it offers is a must. I went out one time in tandem where both adults weighted in at around 150lbs each and I wouldn't want any more weight in the kayak was it was taking in water with light wind on a lake which felt maxed out. Just bought a cheap camp seat to fit in as a second seat as the Aquaglide website didn't sell extra seats. Single handling it was great, not as fast as fiberglass but close. Folded in the backpack it was as heavy as I could bare for minimal hiking (oar/ life preserver and personal gear included.) 1/2 to 1 mile was ok but checking in on an airplane will be a stretch also. I am considering purchasing it again after reviewing what is on the market as it does everything all the others do and more with the accessories offered on the company website.","I bought this kayak last year and have taken it out many times. It handles and tracks really well at the lake. I predominantly go kayaking in Lake Sammamish, and it does well with the waves caused by all the boats. My 9 year old daughter has used it, to my boyfriend (6'1'') to myself (5'7''), and we have all loved it. It is light weight enough for me to load and unload by myself and carry it on my shoulder for several hundred feet.",,"I am 6-4, 225 pounds, and wear a size 15 shoe. Had a lot of trouble finding a kayak in the 12ft range that would fit me comfortably. After lots of research and sitting in many different kayaks - the pungo 125 was the perfect choice! I have had the kayak for about a month now and have taken it out on the water a bunch. Everything people say about the pungos is true - this kayak is extremely comfortable. I could sit in it for hours and not get stiff or feel cramped. The seat is just that comfortable. The stability and tracking of the boat is very good as well. From my experience thus far, this seems to be a well made kayak.
I highly recommend this kayak for larger paddlers.",,,,,"We love the kayak for many reasons...easy to put up and take down, very stable ride which we wanted because were a bit nervous of tipping...but after about 6-8 uses right side bladder started deflating. Discovered a leak on the seam. WHY didn't they overlap the seams instead of pinching them together end to end? STUPID design. Phoned Aquaglide and they don't even make replacement bladders. Will look at other makes for a total replacement kayak. An unfortunate design flaw on what should have been a great inflatable.","Just put in river for first outing. The Rio is light (very nice to carry to and from water), maneuverable, comfortable, responsive, quick. Eddyline appears to be a small family business that adheres to environmentally sound practices. The Rio probably is best for someone not too large--the company spokesperson with whom I communicated said best if inseam is 30 or below (I am probably slighter more than this yet the boat fits great) and no larger that 9.5 shoe size. In addition, I always paddle upstream first, and the RIo cuts right through a fairly swift current. Some reviews I found complained that the Rio seat wasn't comfortable, but I am 62 and find the seat quite comfortable, in every capacity. Finally, the thermo-formed Rio body seems like a perfect choice in between the durability of plastic and the lightness of a composite body. I'm very pleased with my Rio.",This has been a great boat for us. Nice hatches. The cockpit fits me well (6 ft 190lb). Boat performs well in the water. We used the handles as a tie down spot on the car and one broke. Other than that no complaints.,I recently bought this kayak. First time out did a 9 mi. water trail. Found the seat to be very comfortable and really liked the adjustable seat back. Some wind came up part of the trip and the rudder worked well. The overall finish is nice. Having the small hatch in close is a nice touch. I'm pleased with the boat.,,"I bought this 2 years ago and love it. This boat is comfortable, pretty spacious, and stable. I have paddled it in flat water, but mostly use it on rivers. I have taken on many class 2 rapids with no issues (I do have a skirt). I have seen them in stores with a skeg that won't drop, but I have had no issues with mine. My partner ended up purchasing the same boat and we have done overnight camping trips out of them. I would absolutely buy this again.","Pros: Very light weight, easy to travel, easy to carry in a back pack. Easy to setup up.
Cons: Although it's shaped like a kayak this is not a kayak. I had some minor wind wake or wake from distance boats and was getting splashed all over the place.
Overall: If you're out in a remote back country lake that is 100% calm and you just want to 'float' around you should be fine. However, prepared to get wet if you encounter any wake or get wet once you start rowing. I have owned similar weight lrafts (the ones you can get from major department stores in the toy section) that are far safer/out perform this boat. This was a disappointment.",,,,,,,I have now used the kayak a number of times. When I made my previous review perhaps I did not have enough time learning the new kayak. I stand by the statement about the rear bulkhead. I would like to revise my statement about the way this kayak tracks. I spent today paddling in a fair amount of wind. I found the kayak tracking to be phenomenal.,,,"A friend of mine was in Ann Arbor and noticed that there was a Haven for sale there- in April- The Oru web site said that it was due to be released in May- So I was very interested as I had been waiting for a tandem kayak for quite some time... but also wanted it to be transported easily from place to place- as I travel a lot for work and would love to be able to bring a kayak to some of the places I go... It seemed like the perfect storm so to speak.
The team at the Ann Arbor REI was great- they helped my friend check out the kayak by opening it up and putting it together to test out the sizes... currently I am not a small camper- 5'10 and 240... so I needed something I could fit in comfortably but also wanted to be able to store some gear if we were to take it to places like Isle Royal and Lake Powell
With a little bit of time- they put it together.. and since then- with practice- we have been able to pull it together in about 10-15 minutes. I love the stability- The open cockpit is nice in case we want to bring a dog... but also converts to a 16 foot single kayak.
I have yet to really fully test it in more rough waters, windy conditions- etc.. will update my review once I do... but initially- I love this kayak.. I love what Oru stands for- and am now setting my eyes on a Coast XT version for more solo trips on rougher waters... Cant beat the packability of this boat!",,,,,,,"I've had my Coast XT for 2 kayaking seasons and have enjoyed nearly every minute of it. Easy to assemble, easier to break down and transport. A wonderful paddle every time although a little ""tippy"" due to it being so light weight. Seating and back support could be made more comfortable. Inflatable ""stadium seats"" were a simple and inexpensive resolution.","I had an Chelan that I quite liked until it sprung a leak due to a factory defect. Fortunately it was purchased at Rei and they offered me a full refund even though it was out of warranty. I purchased the Blackfoot angler because REI no longer offered the Chelan. Sadly the skeg on the Blackfoot attaches with a tiny screw and bronze plate. Its just plain annoying and a pitifully inept design. Its a stable kayak due to its wide beam, which also means its slow in the water. Would I buy it again? Probably not but I haven't tried other inflatables except for a Hobie which is way out of my price range.","I've had the boat out five times now and it is very comfortable and very stable, perfect for paddling with dogs. I have a 40lb Border Collie and 16lb Mudi, both can fit in the boat with no issue. Comfortable ride south lots of room for storage.",,"Pretty rad. The only beef wish I had the pedal drive. Plenty of storage space and stable. This will do rapids but needs a lot of for sight for fishing set up. The tracks are great, had a scotty set up works good but think some of the fishing stuff should come stock as the extras cost and the boats pricey. But what fun. Did the big south fork tons of action and low flat spots to keep you guessing. The boat is fast and tracks well.",,,,,"I purchased this last week and took it out on it Maiden voyage the very next weekend and it is a sweet ride, very stable, easy to maneuver in the water. I enjoyed it so much I was on the water for 3 hours, the seat is really nice. I like the two positions that the seat can be adjusted to. I would like the center compartment a little bit close to the seat position, maybe when I get my accessories to add to it I may change my mind on that. It is somewhat easy to carry on my shoulders. Love the forward and aft deep compartments. Thinking about getting another one for my wife, she loves mine","I bought this Tetra for my 14 yr old daughter - over the last couple months we've purchased several different Ocean Kayak sit-on-tops for everyone in the family. None of the kids have ever paddled before and where we landed in Texas, we are surrounded by water! - lakes, rivers with hundreds of navigable miles, even the creek behind our house is big enough for them to get the feel of it. The 14-yo ""got it"" within a handful of paddle strokes, easily tracked through some weird below-the-surface counter movement, and can carry it herself for a short distance, even though we usually team up or use a cart b/c why ruin your back early! Love these kayaks, easy to move, easy to use, easy to clean up, low-maintenance, just too easy. Single mold means it won't pop apart if they hit a rock in a river.
I'm including photos of other family OK's as well... my Trident-13's bow in some frames, the girls' Tetra-12, Venus-11, and Venus-10. This is all on a really big creek, not a river or lake!","I purchased the Eddyline Whisper tandem used and wish to offer my experience in that I made a great choice at this phase of life. I would classify myself as an intermediate kayak user on large lakes and rivers. No experience with white water or rough sea trips. I have two Liquid Logic 15' Seneca and Sylva kayaks with rudders for comparison. I wanted a tandem that was wide enough to provide stability for a young child while allowing me to travel with decent speed and maneuverability allowing the fact that I would be doing all of the work and I believe a made a great choice and we have always felt stable. My girl loves the kayak. I can paddle and use the rudder quick enough on the river to allow my daughter to have fun finding approaching leaves in the water and having me steer quick enough for her to grab them before we drift past them. The rudder works great and I can turn pretty quickly considering this is a 18' kayak. I was able to backup and turn 360 at an acceptable effort and had a great time using the kayak. At 73lbs, I can paddle and keep up with my single kayak buddies. This kayak feels stiffer than my plastic single kayaks and is very responsive. I can load it on my F150 TracRac although it did take some technique. To transport it from my truck to the river, I use a CTug cart because it is a bit long for lifting and carrying without a second person. The CTug can be taken apart and fit in the rear hatch. There are a couple factors to be aware of. This tandem is 28"" wide at its widest and some may find it a bit wide for a touring kayak. Only occasionally will I hit my knuckles on the side, but not very often. Perhaps I made a minor change in my paddling style, but I feel very comfortable and don't feel as if I am compensating. When my daughter is older (in a few years) I may purchase a thinner tandem, but I don't feel the need at all right now. There are two storage areas and there is a lot of room. They don't leak and the hard port covers fit securely and are attached with a cord. There is room between the front seat and my feet (in the rear seat) that we can store our lunch or storage containers. I added more deck lines and rigging on the deck top. I bought reflective lines which worked out great because I feel the kayak needed more to be considered a touring kayak. Front and rear paddles will collide if not in sync because the riders sit closer in this tandem. With a little practice, it can be done. The pro is, we can hear each other talk while paddling. We can also hand items back and forth with a little stretching. My other kayak has a cup holder and this does not, but we use camel back bladder packs to hold our water and just run the water hose up over our shoulder and always have water anyway. There is room behind each seat to store the packs. The kayak holds up to the small rocks on the shore line when entering and exiting the river. Cleans up easy and looks great. I'll probably add a 6"" storage kayak hatch for each sitting area and would think they should have been included.",,
"I loved this kayak for the price and I got it for an additional 20% off. I was also looking for one that was rated to 300lbs and an ""open"" one (sit on top) for my 6'8 dad who was paranoid about sitting in a cockpit and not being able to get out incase it flipped, so we purchased this pelican Sentinel. It did float and was great, but for my father who is taller, it sat way too high for him to balance in and as soon as he sat on it I was worried if he would look or twist his torso one way or another he found end up in the water. We ended up returning this kayak and going with the Perception Sound 9.5 model because it sat lower, had the cockpit, that he wasnt thrilled about, and he was able to balance much better. Pros to this model however are that it has a paddle with it","I bought this yak, used it once, and returned it. Cramped cockpit, very difficult to maneuver or hold a line, no bottle holder, molded side handle difficult to hold fast.",,,"Recently a freind and I took the AE 2 person down to Belize for a three day river kayaking trip. We found the setup to be fast and intuitive. We purchased the backbone and were glad we did. Each of us weigh about 185lbs. and we took about 40lbs. of gear each which we strapped on to the stearn and bow using the bungie cord system provided. Even with all of this weight, the kayak tracked well and traveled fast enough to meet our expectations.
I had a Outdoor Research Goretex Bivy with me to sleep in and at the end of the day after we had moved the kayak out of the water and up near our campsite, it occurred to me that I could just move the front seat of the kayak out of the way, place the bivy in the bottom of the kayak and sleep in the kayak. The inflated bottom of the kayak makes for an incredibly comfortable bed. If you decide to try this, make sure you dump the water out of the bottom of the kayak first (it accumulates under the floor panel) and also, dig a small trench to accomodate the small rudder so that it doesn't get bent from resting on the ground. Throw a mosquito net over your new sleeping quarters and your all set. You may still need to pack a tent in the event of rain, but this is a nice alternative when the weather is agreeable.","This is by far the best kayak for stability, and fun. I had a kayak from Walmart that i returned the first day I used it on the water. (I bought this one for my wife.) The walmart one, (Sun Dolphin Bali 10 SS) collected SO much water it wasn't even funny. You couldn't paddle straight without it suddenly taking a sharp turn. I hoped in this one and not one bit of water came into the kayak. Basically what I am trying to say is, If you are in the market for a Kayak, BUY THIS ONE!!! You will not be upset.",Ordered it on line because they didn’t have one at rei at my location. I picked it up at the store. Shipping was pretty fast & the people were very helpfull there. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is the kayak came in blimmised and it looked like there was some repairs done. On top of that I put it on top of a table to mount a paddle holder and one side is about an inch and a half lower than the other. Must of had a mold problem. I’m not real picky but it has some issues. Took it out on the water and it seams ok. The drop down Skeg works really well in keeping you strait.,,It great to go to the beach or just a lake . I would recommend this to everyone and great for kids,Have had it out a few times. At just over 50lbs it’s easy for me to load and carry short distances to the boat ramp out of my pick up truck. Seat has 2 positions and is very comfortable. Feels very stable and tracks well. Not the fastest kayak on the water. Plenty of storage for tackle. Still have to add a rod holder to the rail as well as a cleat for an anchor. I think I’ll be using this for years to come.,,Love being able to pedal and fish. The kayak has some flaws that owners will need to address. Built in rod holders are useless. Can be fixed with pvc pipe and pool noodle or replace with flush mounts. Bracket for pedal drive will need adjustment to keep the drive from popping out of place when peddling. The trolley for lowering and raising the rudder is extremely tight. Best price for pedal kayak on the market and works well when properly tuned up.,"I have now had 4 of these in 4 months. 1 leaked and was exchanged by REI, excellent service. the design of the other 3 were all different. Avoid the ones with snap closures on the bow/stern...very hard/impossible to do for 1 person. look for fastex backpack buckles instead. otherwise, great product for its purpose. Holds 1 person and 1 large/2 small dogs + gear easily. don't buy the bag...flimsy fabric (hole after 1 trip), carry straps do not detach for checking on flights. no way to tie down straps.",,"I have rented touring and sit-on-top kayaks. This is my first kayak purchase. I researched a lot of sites looking for an entry level sea kayak that was light enough for a single person to load; short enough to store in my already full garage; sea worthy enough to safely handle CA pacific coastal bays and estuaries, including surf entries/exits; nimble enough to navigate river delta and marshes. I read that best kayak is not the fastest, sleekest, most storage, etc., but is the one you actually take out frequently because it is light and versatile. Great advice for your 1st kayak. I have had this for about 5 months now and no complaints so far. Ii is super fun. I have paddled in 2-3 ft pacific swells in Santa Cruz and Monterey, made surf entries/exits on shore breaks, as well as more casual paddling in San Francisco Bay, and in its adjacent wetlands and marshes. It tracks well, even in wind, and I feel no need for a rudder or skeg (something I was worried about when lots of 14ft kayaks seemed to come with a rudder or a skeg as standard). It is stable (I have not fallen out yet), but is tippy enough that it is fun to steer with hips. I am 6ft tall and 185lbs and I have found the adjustable seat and foot rests super comfy: 3-4 hours in seat without any pain. The wide range of available adjustment (seat has five settings vs fixed on many other kayaks of similar cost) is great if you have kids or spouse that want to kayak with you occasionally. I often find it easier for to rent a larger kayak from rental shop for myself, and then put my young teenage kids in the Delta. I haven't over nighted anywhere yet, but I am climber/hiker so my UL camping gear would allow me to do 2-3 nights I reckon. My only concern is that I take a little more care around submerged coastal rocks and tight coastal coves in rough water because of the ABS material.",,"Kayak has performed awesome in rough weather. I was caught twice in 1 to 3 foot seas with wind 10-20 mph and it handled it no problem. Was able to catch stripers and blues that the guys from shore weren’t able to reach. I am 6 feet tall and 195 pounds and it is really comfortable for me. I have sat in it for 3-4 hours straight with no soreness. It is also light enough to load into the back of my pickup by myself and unload it after a day of fishing. The two things I recommend if you do purchase this kayak is do not use the pole holders that are behind the seats to hold any poles or nets even if you buy the extensions. The extensions were working fine till I hit rough weather then the net and the extension went for a swim. Which leads to my second recommendation, tie a leash to everything you want to keep. Seriously you will lose things at first. Besides that this thing is a beast.","I am fairly new to paddling, having only paddled low-end recreational kayaks before I cannot compare this boat to anything else. When I went to purchase this boat I was looking for something that I would be able to use on larger water than what I could confidently or easily paddle in my recreational boat, would have room for overnight trips and still work on the smaller rivers around me. I was also hoping to find a boat that I can advance my paddling skills in. So far I'm very pleased with this boat. at 6 foot, 170 lbs, a 34 inch inseam, and a size men's 11 foot this boat fits me very comfortably and allows me to achieve a very firm fit. I sat in several other boats in the same size range but this one felt the most comfortable for me. Since my purchase at the end of July I've had it on several of the lakes around me and on one of the smaller rivers and am very pleased with this boat's handling and feel, it also handles the winds on the lakes nicely. I am very excited to get this boat back onto the rivers after their levels come back up to recommended paddling height.","I love the delta and the features are great including the rudder and the day hatch, the seat is comfortable. I have only paddled it for about 2 hours but it tracks great with assistance from the rudder. The day hatch is awesome and so easy to access. I was a little shocked when a 3 foot drop on the bow keel ended up with a cracked bow, i was prepping the boat on horses and the bow slipped off the horse and hit the concrete driveway. I did not notice the crack util a week later when I went to launch it. I was able to fix with some duct tape as a temp fix, now I am working on a permanent solution. Overall I am very pleased with the boat and would recommend to anyone looking for a good lake boat that easy to transport.","I love this kayak. It is perfect for a fun day at the lake. It is stable in waves and glides nicely through the water. I didn't notice any tracking to one direction or the other like others have mentioned, unless the current is pulling me that way or the wind is causing it. I like the seat and the storage.",,They are NOT Scotty mounts but a cheap knockoff. The square nut can easily spin inside the Aqua pad making it impossible to attach a Scotty rod mount. This happened on 2 different pads on mine. The second time I went to use the boat air leaked heavily from under one of the nuts. Waiting to here from rep about a warranty refund!!! Can't recommend this thing,I've had this boat for several years. It is a joy to Paddle and very stable. It's a little bit slow however Easy to maneuver and I certainly would buy it again. Have mainly used it paddling on Puget Sound..,,"After 12 years in my Pungo120 I was long overdue for a replacement and I've been very much looking forward to the next generation of Pungo. Although I dubbed my original Pungo the best recreational kayak on the market it still had many flaws of which it appears Wilderness Systems has remedied almost entirely over the years. Here's my initial thoughts:
PROS: If the plastic is as high of quality as it was on my original model I don't believe there's anything more durable out there for the weight. Thoughtful design throughout. Best kayak seat on the market! Many options for adjustment. Quality material. Solid handles appear rigid and well constructed. I tied a para-cord loop on mine to attach leashes and transport ropes to. Incredibly stable and roomy! New dashboard design much more useful and customizable. Well constructed foot pads.
CONS: Dashboard did not appear to attach securely or completely in the front. The waterproof container on the dashboard is secure but still rattles around. I'll be doing something to stabilize it so it doesn't make noise while filming. Additional plastic in rear hatch for insert mostly gets in the way. Textured plastic on top of kayak leaves little room for stickers and decals. No dedicated paddle holder. I really thought after seeing the recent Tarpon design they would have included their clever paddle holder.
I'm interested to see how this model stands the test of time and what else Wilderness Systems comes up with in the future. I'll be sure to do a follow up review after this season of Paddle Everything. Follow me here: www.facebook.com/PaddleEverything",,,,,"We loved the kayak at first, used it many times the first year. Second year the floor chambers have popped, it was still usable and replacement floor was not in stock so we kept using it. 2 months ago the left chamber started losing air slowly, again no replacement parts. It's hard to invest into a $600 equipment when it's so easy to render it useless and the Aquaglide company does not stand behind it's products.","I purchased the Rio about a year ago after much research looking for a light weight kayak. I am 70 years old, 5'3"" tall and weigh 120#. I am able to get the Rio on top of my Jeep by myself. I use a Malone kayak cart to get the kayak from the car down to the lake. The Rio is sleek, fast, stable and the envy of all my friends. We have big boats on our lake and it handles all the waves without any problems. After a year of use it still looks brand new.",,"I am 6'2 190lbs. Fit's great. I have owned over 14 Kayaks over the last 20 years or so. This kayak is amazing! Everything is very well thought out. Went from 17'5 foot boats to this 15'5, seems to keep up with longer boats, but much more comfortable. I can't wait to take it out on longer multi day trips. The back rest adjustment is different. But seems to work well. I added a Keel Shield for the front three feet of the keel.",,"Thanks to the reviews here, I tested the skeg when I picked up the boat. I'm glad I did; it didn't work. The nice man at REI fixed it for me by replacing part of the cord that was catching and not allowing the skeg to lift and fall as it should. The boat itself is a big large for me, a 150 lb woman. I have thigh braces coming, which should help me have more control as edging is not going well. However, I did buy this kayak for it's versatility. I'm still new to white water, and spending a fair amount of time on slower water.","From the start this seemed like an overpriced item, but at a very packable 4 pounds I thought that I would give it a try. Plus, hundreds less than many of the other options. A test run in a small pond faired well. It became clear that if you want to stay dry, this needs to be used only on calm waters. The good things people say about this kayak are true. However, when I got home and inflated it to clean it up, I heard a hissing sound coming from one of the attachment patches. Holding it under water released bubbles of air from under the patch, which I never used. I figured I just got a bad one and might try another one. But, in the short time it was under the water, many spots on top of the kayak started to wet through! I don't know it water went all the way into the air chamber, but the top material was saturated in spots. Returned.",,,,,,,I have a bad back and I have a bigger frame. This is the first sit in Kayak I have ever felt comfortable in. Tracks great and my bulkhead stays dry. Love this boat. Heavy boat for larger frame individuals. If your not in need of the width you may stick with a different model.,,,"I bought this product online in REI on May 17, it was meant to be my gift to my wife, however, the Kayak arrived is actually broken, which is heartbreaking and really disappointment.
As you can see from the pictures I attached, although the Oru team claim their product can endure more than thousands of folding, the floorboard on the top when I opened the package is already tearing almost into pieces, and certainly is not capable for sailing in the sea by any standard.
After I found out, I have reached both REI and Oru service team for replacement of the floorboard, however, since the first email I sent on June 2nd, I only got a email of Oru service team confirming for receiving my email, and a email from REI to ask for more detail, and no solution suggested yet, which make the issue even worse.
I will keep update this review so that everyone else interested in this product can have some reference not only in the product quality of Oru kayak, but also in the service quality as well.",,,,,,,,"The Skeg is held in place with a phillips head screw and bronze plate. Forget about this being ""portable"" unless you consider having a screwdriver and very nimble fingers handy when you're heading out. The possibility of losing the screw and plate is exceptionally high, too. Unbelievably poor design. Don't buy. I'm returning mine tomorrow.","My new Eddyline Caribbean 12 kayak is wonderful. Well engineered, efficiently designed and beautifully crafted. While a sit on top is by nature somewhat wider and has a higher center of gravity than a conventional kayak, it is very stable quite confortable, tracks well and has space for everything. My wife has an Eddyline Skylark and it does paddle easier. Both a great boats. I've opted to exert a little more muscle on the paddle in order to enjoy the added comfort and freedom of movement of the sit on top",,,,,,,"I’ve had this kayak for just over 6 months. Great all around kayak. It’s tremendously stable, tracks well and turns well enough. No, it’s not going to turn on a dime or win many races but handles a variety of water well. Recently went on a 5 day river trip, had about 50 lbs of gear on it in addition to my 190 lb self and it didn’t change the performance much at all. Went through numerous class 1 and 2 rapids as well as long stretches of still water into headwinds. Never had any issues. Really solid kayak for the price.",,"We bought our Whisper from REI two years ago and have since paddled Florida, Washington and Colorado. The plastic is a laminate called ""carbonlite"" and it's so much lighter than regular plastic kayaks. The carbonlite is very durable. We hit rocks and oyster beds every now and then - can't use glass or carbon fiber yaks. Compared to our old tandem, a 90-lb plastic XXX, the Whisper sits higher and is more sensitive to crosswinds. Also, the rudder is small and doesn't turn the kayak quickly. However, all that is minor stuff, offset by the light weight - 73 pounds for a plastic tandem - wow! So much easier to lift onto our Thule Hullavator then the old 90-pound pig. Another bonus - being so light and 1 foot shorter than the old pig, it doesn't twist and shake during high cross-winds.",,
I now live right on the banks of the Sassafras River of the Upper Cesapeake Bay. Kayaking is universal here! I needed to add another kayak for family when they visit! This was ideal for my daughter’s use so I got it for her birthday. Last year I got another for my grandaughter’s 7th! We are all in our own boats now!,"I have quite a few kayaks, but I bought this one to play in creeks and rivers, since its short length and high weight capacity (for its size) gives it great bouyancy and agility. It turns on a dime, which is an admirable trait in moving water (though beginning paddlers might be a little frustrated by that trait on flatwater, until they get the hang of it). Great little boat at a great price. It's as stable a craft as my much longer fishing kayaks",,,"This was a great product, I was really happy that I got it. I have a very small car (Nissan Juke) so purchasing a hard shell just wasn't an option. In fact, when I found out that REI stocked this Kayak over an hour from where I was staying I made the 2.5 hour round trip just to buy it.
I really like how it folds up into a pretty small bag, and how easy it is to inflate. I noticed it takes about 10 minutes to inflate with the electric car pump. Unfortunately, I also found out that the car pump doesn't exactly make it very stiff so transporting it was a challenge. I think this process would be made much easier if I used the car pump to fill the majority and then a hand pump to make it ridged. Also, using the added Backbone that you can purchase would make this product so much easier to transport especially coupled with a set of wheels.
Also, I'm not sure if it was because I kayaked in the ocean or not but after a 2 hour trip in the cold water the kayak became very soft as if it was deflating, which made me worried. I left it in the sun on the beach for an hour or so hoping the air would expand... but it did not. So maybe there is a small pinhole I haven't found yet?
End of the day, this is a very nice inflatable kayak. I would highly recommend it to people who don't have a lot of space whether it be for transporting or storing, It is easy to transport, setup, take apart, clean, and do just about anything in... but I would say that it is inflatable so you CAN NOT treat it like a hard shell!","Excellent Kayak....I was looking for 2 kayaks that I can easily fit on top of a small car, and I bought two of these kayaks, they are not heavy, very easy to load and download, is all one piece, so I don't have to worry about seats flying away, and the seats are very comfortable. It is very stable, I had stood up on it and it didn't flip over, I tried it in the ocean, rivers, lakes, and I am very pleased with it. They are not the fastest, but I am comparing it to the 13ft kayak I had before, but overall, is a great purchase!","Plenty of room in the boat and just feels/fits better than the WS Pungo. Boat tracks well paddling with the skeg up, but hooks during glide. With the skeg down the boat tracks solid and glides straight. Mixed thoughts about the seat, appears over-complicated with all the straps and construction / frame. I hope its durable as it looks like a pain to repair if any strap or fitting breaks.
Took 3 weeks from on-line REI order in April to store delivery in May.",,"I got this kayak a couple of weeks ago and have taken it out twice on flat water. It handles really well and is light enough that I can load on and off my Impreza by myself (although getting it up on the rack in my shed is another story). I'm an average sized slightly athletic woman, for what it's worth. It tracks pretty well, although because of its length, it can get spun in a current or wind fairly easily. I also really love the look and the seat is very comfy. The little extra features are nice such as the pads on the lip for carrying comfort/knee rests, and the little protected compartment up front. My one BIG gripe and the reason I am giving this boat 3 stars is that the drain plug is IN the waterproof storage. What does that mean, you ask? That if you capsize, as I did today (which is a whole other pride-swallowing story) and you fill your boat, you have no easy way to bail it. The plug only drains the WATERPROOF COMPARTMENT. It's really, really poorly thought-out design. Did Pelican had a reason for doing this? If so, I'd love toe hear it. So what that means is I had to lift my full kayak onto rocks and turn it over - but I still can't get all the water out, even after tipping it again at home. I'm having to sop the water out with towels. So. Dumb.
Anyway, it's definitely a cadillac kayak in features, but the design has left me questioning. I am either going to return it (sob) or drill a hole through the bulkhead into the waterproof compartment so it can drain properly.","the kayak is fine the seat is comfortable, the only complaint is about the adjustable seat straps have plastic clips that are prone to break, they seem to be hard to get. have had kayak for 15 month and have had to replace clips twice.",,"Our family currently owns paddle boards, a canoe and other kayaks. Managing any of these while fishing by myself in a breeze has been a challenge. I have watched YouTubes and read about pedal kayaks for a couple years. I struggled deciding amongst the various choices. This Spring we went ahead and bought the Pescador Pilot Pedal Kayak at REI. The whole family loves it. Here are a few observations. 1.) Consider that the back of the lifejacket becomes part of how you sit in the seat, and thus how comfortable the pedaling is. Experiment with a few different life jacket models. 2.) We are a fit family that boats a several times a month (we aren’t kayak or canoe racers). We found that a comfortable pedaling pace moves the boat faster than we can easily paddle a kayak or canoe, and the rudder makes steering extremely easy. 3.) It is very stable. We frequently move family members between the various watercraft mid-lake. Without getting in the water. 4.) If you work with the wind, and practice steering and pedaling backwards, you can do an amazing job of holding yourself just off shore while fishing, then, backing out into deeper water once a fish is hooked (so you can focus on the fight rather than getting pushed into the shallows by the wind). 5.) It takes proper pedal drive setup (read the instructions) and some practice to raise the drive-in haste. My teenagers mastered it their first day. The drive does stick a fair distance down under the boat. You need to pay attention to the water depth. 6.) A paddle can be put away and retrieved from the built-in holder with one hand, that was a cool surprise. 7.) It is a heavy boat, especially when rigged, so wheels for transport are desirable. We bought a simple inexpensive wheel set that can be strapped on through the scupper holes. We made custom straps for it. It is far more stable when bouncing down a trail or in deep sand, than most small boat setups tied by wrapping around the boat. 8.) It is extremely stable on the roof right side up, which is ok since it is self-bailing. It was a bit big for our angled kayak carrier, and due to its weight harder to mount (we don’t have a pneumatic lift). 9.) We feel pedaling barefoot allows you to hook your toes over the pedals giving a better grip when going between forward and reverse to hold in place while fishing.
If I could recommend two things to the manufacturer it would be: 1.) Have two lift handles at the back. One offset (due to the rudder) causes the boat to rock to the side when lifting the back to slide it onto the car roof. 2.) Use aluminum not plastic accessory and seat rails.
I did get a chance to try a Malibu and an Old Town some weeks back (after my purchase). Speaking with those owners I did not feel I had, in any way, made a bad decision. The Malibu had a different pedal motion, and lower pedals, but no reverse. The ability to go in reverse is a huge feature when fishing.
We love this kayak.","I live in a neighborhood that is within a short walking distance to a river. Several of my neighbors have kayaks, but none of them have a folding kayak that they can carry like luggage. After just two practice runs, I can set this up in 8 minutes. It tracks well in the water, and is very convenient for storage. I highly recommend this kayak, especially for those that have limited transportation options and/or storage space. I love it!",,I've owned this boat for 2 years and paddled many miles in it. The build quality is excellent. Tracks very well. Hatches don't leak. I have nothing bad to report. It's worth the money.,,"Just bought two Perception Pescador 12.0 sit on top kayaks. I am very happy with them. They provide a stable platform for fishing, also when paddling swifter portions and small rapids (NOT ""white water). They paddle easily through calm sections. Get long paddles. I prefer the 250's. Also have a Perception Pescador Pro 10 and a Wilderness Systems Tarpon 10.",Great boat for the windy marshes and bays of the Texas gulf coast. Drop the skeg and the yak faces downwind. pull it up and she noses upwind. Half-skeg for adjusted tracking. I have the lime green boat for other boats and ships to see me when crossing high traffic channels especially at dawn or dusk. Great boat combined with a traditional Inuit paddle. The skeg allows me to move my feet around as I am sometimes in the boat for 10 hours without beaching.,"This is my first kayak, so I don't have a lot of experience to compare it to. I have Kayaked several times prior to this purchase (once during an REI learn to kayak class). I have taken it out about 10 times and I'm happy I bought this one. It seams faster than the kayaks I used previously. It's light and easy to carry to the water over my shoulder. The hatches work well and the day hatch in front of the cockpit is great for things you might want out on the water. My only complaint is that the seat is a little hard. I use my padded cycling shorts, seams to help a bit. Overall very happy with it.",I do not like that it is hard to keep going in a straight direction when paddling on a river. It wants to veer to the left. The seat does not tighten down far enough to give stable support of the back. I much prefer the caper!,,"I've taken my Blackfoot on many trips, including multi-day expeditions, and it has never disappointed.","I started kayaking 20 years ago when I purchased a recreational, plastic, flat-bottom kayak. I used it mainly on lakes and ponds. Lots of fun, very durable, but not much in the way of performance and heavy to lift on one's own. Last month I purchased the Eddyline Rio mainly because I wanted a higher performance kayak, and one that I could carry on my own. However the Rio proved to be too small - does not fit if your pant leg inseam is more than 30 inches, which mine was. So I immediately exchanged the Rio for the Skylark. Perfect fit, just a bit heavier than the Rio, and great performance - just what I was looking for. I paddle almost exclusively on ponds, lakes, and rivers. A bit tricky to enter and exit because the hull is not flat, thus not as stable as I was used to, but I quickly got that solved. Best of all is the increase in performance. Pretty attractive in the water, too.",,"I purchased this boat to handle the wind and tidal currents in the southern Connecticut River, I also have a sit on top fishing kayak that is a stable platform for fishing , but slow and sluggish in wind and current, I tried various Wildy boats and found the Pungo 125 was the right boat due to the re engineered hull, good adjustable seat and one rear hatch with a locked down cover. I placed a flotation bag in the bow to compensate for no forward bulkhead. The cockpit has easy access and egress ,even with the new dash console. Wilderness finally put together a fine package at an attractive price. Along with a carbon fiber paddle the boat cuts through current and wind well with excellent track and glide.
paddle , this boat rocks.",,,,,"High quality, but is too boyent for my 150 lbs, 3 ft of bow is out of water. I would not recommend for day use as set and take down, then reinflate to dry out is time consuming. Would be great for touring, loaded down with supplies. Seat is really low and needs to be a couple inches higher.","I can't say enough about the Rio. It is the perfect fit for a small paddler. I'm 5'4"" and have always had a hard time with kayaks being too wide. The Rio is my Perfect fit! I don't have to worry about my paddle hitting the sides of the kayak because I am sitting so low and the cockpit is too wide. The fit is such that if I were to go over, I wouldn't fall right out of the seat and I could attempt to roll. It is light weight, so getting out on the water is not a heavy hassle. Also, like the other reviewer said, it is FAST! I'm used to sea kayaks and this boat is just like a mini sea kayak. The lines are beautiful and it handles very easily. Even scrambling up on the back deck, the lock bar is placed far enough to the stern that you won't get hung up on it.",,,,"I've had my kayaks for quite a while now and absolutely LOVE them. skeg makes a straight line VERY easy for everyone, myself, kids, and grandkids all enjoy them and there has NEVER been a problem with our skegs.","Pros: Light, handles great on the water, tracks better and is faster than a packraft, does fine in slightly choppy water, can be inflated by mouth in a reasonable amount of time(but their packlite pump is worth the purchase). Lots of leg room, I have a 36"" inseam and have room to spare in front of my feet.
Cons: Low weight limit, back end has limited abrasion resistance compared to other rafts in it's weight class, 'ripstop' fabric has no ripstop properties(see below).
I took this raft out on a local, mellow creek. The water level was low, and I dragged the back end across a few shallow gravelly sections and a couple of logs. On the last log I dragged it across, the back end, which sits low in the water, caught something and the raft tore. ENTIRELY MY FAULT! However, the tear was in a dead straight line, and when I gently pulled on the two sides of the tear it tore further very easily. The grid of reinforcing threads did nothing to stop the tearing.
Repairing the raft was actually pretty easy. I repaired it myself, instead of contacting Advanced Elements, because the tear was definitely my fault, not theirs. I reinforced the inside with regular Gorilla Tape, then Aquasealed the split. Once the Aquaseal cured, I applied a layer of clear Gorilla Tape across most of the bottom of the back end of the raft. I recommend anyone purchasing this raft apply a layer of Clear Gorilla Tape in that area preemptively as well. It will prevent what I feel are inevitable leaks from abrasion dues to occasional shallow water, especially while launching.
Since the repair, the raft holds air just fine, holds my 215 lb + clothing weight just fine, even when my 35 lb dog is added. I still like the way it handles and tracks, I just wish it had actual ripstop fabric(hence the deducted stars).
If Advanced Elements is listening: Use a more durable floor material, especially in the back end of the raft! Make the tubes slightly bigger as well to increase weight capacity. Even at a pound heavier, these improvements would up my rating to 5 stars, and make the raft a lot more versatile.",,,,,,,The hatch does nothing to stop water no matter how small the amount. Only water from padding was in the boat and the buckhead was completely wet inside. Tracking wasn't that great either. Not sure if I received a faulty boat or what.,,,"I absolutely wanted to love this kayak, and already have owned an Oru Bay for a few years which I love. Unfortunately, Oru seems to have substantially lowered their manufacturing standards and quality control for this particular boat. I received the same defective floor boards as others have reported, along with seat straps that slip for no reason and the metal strap ends bend with little force. Also had a rivet start failing which holds the floor board straps to the kayak body. Kept for about a month and three separate uses before I decoded to return due to the poor quality and experience.
If I see that Oru has upgraded or redesigned this boat in a year or two, it’s almost a sure thing that I would try it again",,,,,,,,"I agree with the other reviewer about the skeg requiring a screw - how incredibly stupid of a design! Especially since the other Blackfoot model doesn't require this. That boat is nearly identical, and they found a way to attach the skeg without a screw, so what happened here???
But I wouldn't go so far as giving this boat one star for that single factor. I normally carry a Swiss army knife with a screwdriver, so that problem's solved.
Everything else about the boat is very nice. I'm very pleased with this kayak - just took it out again this weekend to paddle around a big lake in my area, and the boat is just awesome. I'm brand new to kayaking, btw.
It inflates very easily. Just three points to inflate.
It all fits in a backpack - it's kind of big, but doesn't weigh much, and is easy to carry. The backpack has a lot of extra room for accessories, the pump, etc. I have a tiny apartment in NYC, and this is perfect for me as a regular kayak would never work.
The other problem is the seat that comes with it - it's way too low, at least for me. I ended up ordering the ""professional"" inflatable, higher seat (for extra $$), and that solved the problem. But it should come with that seat standard, as does the other Blackfoot model.
Overall, besides the two problems mentioned, I'm very very pleased with this boat, and it has opened up a whole new world of aquatic adventure for me.",Man I love my Caribbean 12. Great all around kayak for flat water rivers and lakes. Great for fishing and just cruising. Very high quality and very well designed. Did I say I love it. Perfect little boat.,,,,,,,"Pretty light at 64 lbs. Great features, especially for the price. Paddles very well into a tough headwind. It could use scupper plugs in rougher water. And it would be nice if somebody would figure out what a novel idea it would be to put scuppers in all of the low points in the yak: like under your seat and where the depression is for your tackle box. Rod holders are poor, but can be drilled out and changed. Not a big deal overall. Comfy seat and quite stable.",,"This is some piece of work. Great style, elegant and super glidy. No cup holders doe, stayed afloat",,
"I like this boat for the price. It is easy to paddle and light enough to carry alone. but I wanted something to use on rivers and lakes and this isn't it. The scupper holes for self bailing are so small that once you go through a wave the boat stays full of water for at least a full minute. During that time the boat is to the gunnels in the water and has no stability. Even small class II waves fill the boat and make it unpleasant. For a cheap boat on a flat lake, this is fine for a toy.","I've had my kayak for a couple years....the bottom seat blew out on a trip home. I contacted customer service to see about purchasing a new one. Much to my surprise, customer service sent me a replacement at no cost. Very surprised & impressed!",,,"I live in a 700 SF crammed apartment in the Bay Area, but I love kayaking. I was tired of paying ±$100 every weekend to rent a kayak, so I did extensive, months long research on inflatable kayaks. I found a few places to try them out locally and this kayak just won me over. It's the perfect size to be storable and transportable, and considering that it is an inflatable it does pretty well on the water! I can carry it by myself uninflated and it is perfectly manageable for 2 people inflated. No need for a cart.
Things that I love about it:
- Easy to inflate after the first few times/practice. I can now get it completely inflated in 10 minutes. - Easy to un-inflate and pack away (but the bag that it comes with can get crammed if you don't do a good job re-packing) - Fits in the back of a miniature Chevy Spark perfectly - Super stable on the water, even in windy conditions or rough water. It rides low in the water and won't ever tip or sway. It does get pushed around quite a bit in heavy wind. - Easy to paddle and pretty maneuverable
Things I wish there were improvements for:
- Won't fit tall people if you're planning on using it tandem. Tried to go out with a 6'4 friend, and it just wasn't happening. I was crammed, he was crammed, we all weren't too terribly happy. I'm 5'4 and can paddle with other people 5'8 and under super comfortably. - If you wear a PFD that goes down to your waist, it will ride up due to the seat structure in this yak. The back of the seat pushes up the back of the PFD as you paddle.
I got the tandem deck conversion and am so glad that I did - although it is nice to paddle ""topless"" you get pretty wet and I've gotten a third degree sunburn from forgetting to reapply sunscreen! It makes it a little more difficult to get into, but still not hard at all. It increases the stability ten fold in choppy or rough conditions. It also stops big wakes from speedboats or windy conditions!
We also had to get wider paddles for this then is suggested for my height - I find that my 240 cm paddles are the sweet spot.
This yak has been in the mountain lakes, reservoirs and the Bay and I just love taking it out. It is so much fun, and I can't wait to have it for years to come.","The first half hour on this puppy I thought I was going to hate it. I have never used a sit-atop and it seemed very ""tippy"" to me compared to the various cockpit style kayaks I have used before. But after that half hour, total bliss. I was on a river with surface calm but a very strong current after massive rains, and it handled extremely well. Actually, more than well. It was a joy.","I've taken this out 4 times now. Once on a calm canal and the other times in tidal water. It performs great. WIth or without the skeg, it tracks pretty straight. I am glad i bought a kayak with a bulkhead. It keeps my stuff nice and dry in the hatch. The hatch is also very easy to open. I am very satisfied with this Kayak. The only downside is that it does not have a drain plug, but I have had no issue getting water out with just a sponge.",,,"I've had the kayak for almost 3 months now and have taken it out on average once a week and have really enjoyed using it in a few different lakes. I had hoped the 32"" width would provide enough stability to fish standing, but it's just not quite stable enough for standing comfortably at all, fishing or not. Sitting however, even in the high position is plenty stable, I find and paddling is fine in either position, but from the lower I find paddling is a bit easier. I've not tipped the kayak ever nor really felt close either while just fishing or paddling. Speed is not amazing, but its a relatively wide kayak and it's not to be expected. On average I paddle at a comfortable 2.5 mph according to the fish finder speedometer and can get up to 4 or 4.5 mph if I'm really going at 100% for short bursts. Tracking is decent for a 10.5 kayak it seems.
The kayak has a great use of space with a very large rear storage area for a large crate. I added PVC pipes into the fishing rod holder holes to narrow the width and lengthen them as the holes are too large on their own and not deep enough for fishing poles and they will bounce around constantly and/or fall out. I don't consider this a negative however as there are a lot of things you can do with the molded in fishing pole holes such as quickly add cheap PVC as I did, create a PVC outrigger system, attach a trolling motor mount, and or create other storage systems.
The front storage is a good size and the front console open/close storage compartment is the perfect size for a fish finder battery and a great spot to mount a fish finder base. The front scupper is perfectly placed to run fish finder transducer cables and the recessed area is very handy to mount the transducer on the underside of the kayak without having to have the transducer exposed to possibly damage it. I attached my Garmin Striker 4cv to a PVC pipe going from the front storage through the scupper and to the underside where the recess is and its a great permanent (but easily removable if necessary, without damage or drilling holes) while allowing the transducer to function and avoid scrapes from low water areas.
The kayak is on the heavier side for managing and lifting alone onto and off of a car but it is certainly doable. I wish the handles were complete jug handles that you could wrap your hands through, but instead they are just indented so you cant get a complete grip through them. Still, better than nothing. The handles on the bow and stern are sturdy and useful for carrying with somebody else or when tying down to your vehicle.
As far as comfort, the seat is super comfortable and I have no complaints with back pain or discomfort even when out on the water for 5+ hours, and I highly prefer the comfortably lawn chair style seat to any other kayak seats I sat in when making my choice.
The side of the kayak has a nice flat ledge that is perfect for mounting an anchor trolley system (Yakattack) and it functions great once installed. The gear track system is useful as well, and I've got a paddle holder clip in one and a rod holder in the other and have not had any issues thus far. The included paddle bungee also works fine, but just takes an extra second or two to use each time.
I find with a full load of a battery, fish finder, 3 fishing rods, crate with lures/supplies/ 3lb anchor, etc... and me (150lbs) that the kayak handles the weight fine and the water comes to the scupper hole level. Without all the gear its noticeably less. The only time i get water in is when first getting in the kayak typically, so I placed some foam golf balls in them to keep this from happening and it works perfectly.
The foot braces work well, but aren't the most durable seeming as one was broken when I picked mine up from REI but they quickly replaced it in store, but it seems you should be somewhat careful with them as they are not not super heavy duty.
Overall, I love the kayak and would definitely recommend it. It is significantly higher quality, thicker plastic and much more durable and accepting of abuse compared to the cheap Sun Dolphins, and Tamaracks you see for $200-300 at Wal-Mart and Academy, etc... The only thing wishlist items I could realistically ask for would be to add full jug handles on the sides and just a hair wider to be able to fish standing, but as a balance for all my wants, this is about as good as I could have asked for.",,"I purchased this kayak September 2017. I used it about a dozen times. Immediately I had trouble keeping the pedal drive in the down position. As you pedal, it would lurch forward into the up/stow position. I contacted Perception. They said to loosen the screws and reposition the mount to make the pin hold the pedal drive in the down position tighter. I did that and it was fixed. The pin became very difficult to install and remove. It kept the pedal drive in place. The stowing of the pedal drive was a challenge. You have to visualize the prop to line it up to retract it. It is almost impossible to stow quickly. Other than all those complaints, I enjoyed the kayak. Next, the rudder appeared to turn left better than right. I noticed the cable was a bit loose. I adjusted that. The steering still acted a bit sluggish. The kayak was fairly stable. The pedal drive was very responsive. I began to notice the pedal drive was becoming noisy. The noise was coming from the upper part by the pedals. I contacted Perception and asked about the noise and steering. I was not given an answer that made sense. Maybe I called on a bad day. The kayak was roomy. Lots of room for gear. The cup holder is in a good place. The seat was very comfortable. Nice compartment space. The were plenty fishing pole holders. I really wanted to like this kayak. The price was good. It was on the very low end for pedal drives. I returned it to the store and am buying an old town predator PDL.","My sister and I picked up a used Oru Beach LT in store. Without written instructions, we figured out how to assemble this the first time in 20 minutes by following videos of other people doing it online and mimicking them. When my sister (who struggles to change the batteries in a remote) was able to assemble it in 5-10 minutes on her own (only the second time assembling it) and fold it up in about 10 minutes, we knew this would work for her.
Here is a good tip for the snaps and ratchets, don't just try pushing down, hold the kayak between your legs and gently squeeze your knees together, to bring the two pieces together first, to make engaging the connection easy.
It was fun to paddle, my labrador dog fit between my legs/feet, and it kept 300 lbs (me + the dog) afloat on a flat water lake. Very unique product that serves a definite purpose without compromising the fun of casual kayaking.
We like it so much we are buying a second one.",,"I just got this kayak as a birthday gift, it is the first kayak that I have owned. It arrived (shipped to my house) in perfect condition as far as I can tell, and it is beautiful. The colour (red) is very bright and the finish is shiny, it looks much nicer than a rotomolded PE boat to my eye. I would recommend opening the hatches for the first time in a well ventilated area, because it smells very strongly of epoxy when you open them, but once they aired out I haven't noticed anything. The deck lines are all in recessed ridges in the deck with handy dents so you can get a finger under them. All of the bolts appear to have rubber gaskets on the inside of the boat to limit leakage when you have water on the deck. The carry handles are comfortable and sturdy, at least for the short trek from the parking lot to the water near my house. All that to say, the fit and finish is exceptional, I had heard good things and I wasn't disappointed in the least.
As far as paddling it, my point of comparison was some sit on top boats that I had borrowed from friends, and this is a lot more fun. I don't know if it is faster, because I haven't raced anyone yet, but it feels a lot quicker, the acceleration is light and it goes more or less in a straight line, even with a few inches of chop. In smooth water at a gentle pace the hull is nearly silent, quiet enough that I could sneak up on a bird eating a fish on the beach and get pretty close, so if that's what you want to do, you should be happy, I guess. The seat is pretty comfortable, I spent about 3 hours in it today and my butt and lower back are not doing too badly, and it is easy to adjust, the mechanism is simple and should be durable, and it adjusts in front of you (at least leaning forward and back, not the height adjust) which is convenient. My favorite adjustment, however, is that the whole seat slides forward or back into maybe 5 different positions. This allows me to get my thighs inside the padded thigh braces without slouching, I'm not very tall (~5'9"") and was able to get a good fit. The foot braces are also adjustable and seem pretty sturdy, plus the platforms are comfortable enough for bare feet. The boat feels stable and gives me confidence to edge a little. I was in paddling in pretty flat water, but when I got the wake from speed boats passing by, the 12.10 did just fine, no matter which direction the swells hit, it stayed collected even though I am a total novice. The hatches appear to be mostly water tight, I would still put my stuff in dry sacks if I was going on a trip, but my phone (in a waterproof case) did fine in the day hatch, though after a few hours of practicing rolls (unsuccessfully) and reentries (hilarious, but successful) there were small puddles in the larger hatches.
Overall, I am totally in love with this thing, it is a lot of fun and it has given me a lot of confidence. I am having a blast and have ordered a Delta 12.5 catfish sit on top for my wife (I had to special order it because REI doesn't stock them at the moment, so it isn't here yet, but based on this one I am really excited)",,Bought a new Pescador 12 from REI. It paddles exceptionally well. Tracks straight and is easy to paddle. The seat is very comfortable. I highly recommend this kayak,,"Having paddled the rental boats in the area, and not wanting a ton of roto mold to haul I now own this kayak. Not for a minute in the last year have I regretted this purchase. This boat is exactly what Delta says it is, one great boat. It is light, confortable, stable, easy to bring to speed, turns lightly, and paddles effortlessly! Then drop the rudder in a strong wind and know your work just got easier. I love this boat!",,,,"There are several reviews that mention the preference for thigh braces on the Skylark. Rest assured that this boat does feature thigh pads under the deck as assorted at REI. For most users, this is the most desired (and Eddyline recommended) configuration. When edging, it is easy to make contact with this standard padded region. Some smaller paddlers, that come from a reference of a touring kayak fit, have been able to ask REI/Eddyline to install a different cockpit (ie. Equinox). These sized paddlers may also consider the Rio for a closer ""touring"" fit. Ease of entry and comfort for mid to larger size paddlers is reduced when adding this customized ""thigh brace"" to the Skylark (Equinox cockpit). It will also limit the comfort of any medium/large paddler who doesn't want a tight fit. If you do plan to ever rest your knees up against the coaming in a higher position, the thigh braces that the above reviews mention will make this uncomfortable. Eddyline sells a “Sandpiper knee pad” that is also an after-market comfort option for resting your legs against the cockpit (when knees up). Please be careful to not fall into the trap that just because an option is out there that it is best for you. Not every reviewer here is your size or shares your desire. The Skylark is designed to be an easy entry and versatile performance recreational kayak. If a tighter fit is desired, you might also consider more advanced models.",,"The new Pungo 125 is the perfect kayak for larger guys wanting a rec kayak for paddling lakes and rivers. I’ve only used it one time so far. Looking forward to getting out again next weekend. Very easy to paddle, tracks well and has good stability.",,,,,,"Rio is perfect for, as Eddyline says, small to medium paddler looking for hybrid kayak with good stability and good tracking. Easy to put on top of vehicle.",,,,"I love this boat. But even more I love the service that I received at the REI Dublin store. I highly recommend this boat to any person who is looking for a boat that will grow with their skills and is in a realistic price range. From the first moment I put this boat in the water I have felt successful, free, and safe on the water.","Okay here’s a review from an ocean-goer on Oahu. Took it out for a test fly from Kamaaina Beach around mid-day. There was no parking of course (doesn’t anyone work anymore?!), but this just highlighted one of the Packlite’s advantages: I parked at Kapiolani park and set it up and just strolled over to the beach. Only 1/10 of a mile, but it was so easy; this thing weighs nothing. I have to say this does not assuage the feeling that you’ve got a pool toy. Set up was also incredibly easy. I used a foot pump but needed to ghetto-up some ¾” tubing (hardware store) to fit the two main valves. On the water: this thing moves along and is incredibly maneuverable. I mean turns on a dime. That’s also a downside, though, since the nose follows the paddle about a foot with every stroke (yawing?). I got into a rhythm of sorts after a while and I’ve read that having a weight in the front helps with this. So if you’re geared up it might be a non-issue. I had to adjust my paddling as the shaft would hit the sides of the raft when using my usual stroke. Had to not pull as deep and use more of an angle. Longer paddle might help (think mine’s a medium length). I’m 5’11” on a good day and feet were still around 6” short of touching the nose. Overall, I’d be really stoked with the combination of portability and performance, but I’m really unsure how this thing will hold up. I have a Innova Sunny which seems bullet proof for comparison, but it’s also 10-times heavier. For a first time paddle I was apprehensive about going out into Scary Blue Water—it just feels flimsy. I’ll give it a 4 for now and maybe update after I’ve gone through some scrapes or bounced off some rocks. (Hey, REI return policy is one of the reasons I pulled the trigger on this.)",,,,,,,,,,"Like other reviewers, I really want to like the Haven kayak. G-hooks slip. Paddle glue joints failed (I bought Oru’s carbon fiber). Contacted customer support numerous times and was promised replacement G-hooks and paddles, but they never shipped.",,,,,,,,"I've had an Aquaglide Blackfoot HB SL for 2+ years (3 seasons) and it does not have a screw in skeg. It has the quick release skeg described in the Aquaglide (current) catalog: (The Blackfoot Angler comes with a high-performance fin system includes a stiff, durable, foiled fin with unique quick-release for easy setup.) I recently ordered a spare directly from Aquaglide ($9.95 i believe) and it too is a quick release. See photo.
My review: This is my second inflatable. My 1st was an Airis Sport 11. I'm really pleased with the Blackfoot.
-It tracks reasonably well. -is pretty swift. I have no issues keeping up with fellow anglers. -it is as rugged as you could expect an inflatable to be. The seams etc are much better than my Airis (the cause of its final demise yesterday). -quite stable. I've never attempted to stand in it, but I have seen video of such. -i have the standard seat and it's 'ok'. My usually trip time is 5 hours or so. I don't like the rod holders in the seat, they interfere with paddling and the rods often get hung up in trees etc. -the removable skeg is neat. I often float swift, shallow, rocky rivers and remove the skeg allowing me to go in very shallow water. -it's very difficult to control in open water without the skeg (I forgot it once). -I'm not shy about scraping bottom through rapids and have had no issues with bottom tares. -love the Scotty mounts -my only complaint is its performance in wind. It sits higher than my Airis and considerably more difficult to paddle into a headwind.
General notes on inflatables: -so convenient. We camp/travel a lot and always toss them into the truck. -light. My wife can manage easily. -your gonna get leaks. Don't panic. I've been out all day more than once knowing I had a leak. Watch some YouTube videos on repairs. Doing it right is important. -buy a 12 volt pump. I have a BTP Turbo. We'll worth the $.
I'm in the process of replacing the Airis and another Aquaglide is definitely in the running.
Have fun!",It's what I was looking for. I like the quality -- check out the videos about the company. Excellent service at the flagship store!,,,,,,,"I'm 6' & 240lbs- this is a very stable and comfortable kayak. Has a lot of good features like the space for the 12v battery and fish finder. Plains out very well, also handles waves very well.",,,,
,I bought this kayak last summer along with two other Lifetime kayaks. This kayak is comfortable and easy to paddle. Easily paddle 5 miles on Jackson Lake in both calm and rough conditions. Love it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],,,"Took out the Advanced Frame Convertible inflatable kayak on flat water. Tried it first without the double deck conversion or the backbone and it was great. Easy to get in and out of, even after a swim in the water, VERY comfortable, goes straight and fast. Tried it then with the backbone and didn't really notice the difference. Maybe it is required when the water is choppy, but for flat water, it wasn't worth the bother of putting it in. Tried it then with the double deck conversion - that was nice as it gave a bit of sun protection for the rear paddler, but not absolutely necessary unless you wanted to attach a skirt.","I bought this boat about three weeks ago to take the place of another that was on an infinitly long back order. I have since returned it and found a more comfortable Perception Tribe 9.5 elsewhere. It's a good little boat though, good sized rear storage, doesn't take on much water. The seat and back rest, however, are not my favorite. The molded back is a bit harsh on the spine and the seat area is a bit large for a more slender kayaker. After a while sitting in the boat I would like to be able to adjust the back, the molded seat is a bit uncomfortable for a long day on the water. Doesn't track as well as the same size Tribe by Perception. The fishing rod holders are a cool addition. All in all, it's a great little boat but left me wanting a bit more out of the seat comfort.","Have had this on Class I-III and lots of flat water too, hasn't let me down. Plenty of room for camping gear with a large weight capacity and wide cockpit, good for us bigger folks. Wish it had a front hatch for additional storage but that's about my only complaint, it's a solid boat.",,,"I just bought this boat and got it out into the water this weekend. As a beginner, it was intuitive on how to secure the seat/chair. The mesh suspended chair kept my butt pretty dry. Adjusting the foot pegs was a snap and the stability of the boat made for a relaxing ride.",,"Had to return two kayaks because of issues - one mechanical, the other cosmetic (three gouges from handling). Third one had issue of rudder not locking into place - but can live with that. Have to wait till Spring to get it on open water to see how well it works. No other pedal kayak compared to the price so thought it was worth exchanging for same model. REI was great dealing with the returns.","After months of research, we bought two Beach Kayaks. Brought them home and spent five days practicing assembly on one of them. Each time we left it sit assembled overnight to help loosen the folds. Then we took them back. Everything was doable--except the ratchets. The straps aren't long enough. The boat needs to be almost fully cinched together to have any hope of engaging the ratchet. If you are one person, good luck cinching the boat, holding the bulkhead in place, and threading and cranking the ratchet all at once. Two people could do it with practice but, for me, one purpose of a light-weight, foldable kayak was to be able to go on my own. The release lever is small, hard to get fingers and leverage on, and just a bit sharp. Just pulling it up did not always disengage the strap; sometimes it takes a lot of yanking. Called Oru twice, during their business hours, to get advice. Nobody picked up. So disappointed. REI was, of course, great. Always friendly and efficient.",,"A Delta kayak will cost you more than a rotomolded polyethylene boat and it's well worth it. The thermoformed ABS material that Delta uses produces a gorgeous finish that looks and performs like a composite boat, but costs less and is more durable. The 12.10 is essentially a sea kayak in a smaller package that is well suited to light touring (up to 3 days or so) on large lakes, slow moving rivers and coastal waters. It also performs well in ocean swells and in the surf. If you're looking for a whitewater kayak or a boat for extended touring, however, look elsewhere. The 12.10 is a light, fast little boat that is very stable, tracks and edges well, and turns on a dime. Fit and finish are top notch. As with it's larger models, Delta cut no corners on the 12.10 - everything from the seating system to the hatches to the bulkheads to the deck rigging and the perimeter lines exude quality and performance. You will also feel very safe in this boat. Simply put, nothing in its class even comes close. Spend the extra $400-$500 that this kayak will cost you. I guarantee that you'll be glad you did.",,,,"I have been paddling my delta 14 for about 2 years now. I paddle mostly in puget sound and lake Washington. I have taken it to the San Juan islands a few times too. I used to paddle a heavy polyurethane kayak so this feels like lightweight luxury but at a reasonable price. For me it's the perfect compromise between lightweight / expensive carbon (that I would be paranoid was going to be scratched or stolen) and heavy poly. I take reasonable care of it but it does get ran up the beach, bumped on concrete launches, sat on the sidewalk or road while I unload. Again, I don't have to worry about it too much and I like that.
I had some concerns before purchasing and after reading the comments on the cockpit / seat and day hatch, but those haven't been an issue for me. I am 6' 200lb and I don't have any problems getting in and out of the kayak.
For me the day hatch position is ideal. I like having my camera, snacks, sunscreen etc right there in front of me without needing to contort in the seat. I have practiced self and assisted rescues in the puget sound and have never struggled to get back in. Maneuverability is great and tracking is fine. I never use the rudder although I might be tempted in a really strong cross wind.
I have called delta a couple of times with questions and been very impressed with their response / customer service.",,,,"Fast, lightweight, stable, very comfortable, easy in and out, and oh by the way drop dead gorgeous. I am 5' 10"", 175 lbs. and 73 years old, so I needed something light enough to carry and roof mount. But I also wanted it to be fast enough to keep up with the kids. I use it for day trips on lakes and rivers. Mission accomplished. Love this kayak and will paddle it until I can't. No one will be disappointed with this kayak, unless you need one for whitewater, or long distance cruising with equipment.",,"I'm 6'4"", 320 lbs, so it's a hard hit against a product that the average paddler loves. But the rating on this boat suggests that it would work well for my size. The boat didn't sink so it's technically doing its job, but not stable. Plus, the little dashboard that came with it is worthless. Difficult to install, even the salesperson trying to help me could not get it installed to show me how to install it. It also rattles around a bunch so makes a ton of noise in the wind if you leave it on during transport. Cup holders are very shallow so no cup or bottle is going to stay upright. There are very few accessories/options for this boat, so I'm stuck with the seat that came with it. Not a complete loss but I'm not impressed.",,,,,,,,,,"I’ve had this kayak for 6 years and it is by far my favorite kayak. It is a little heavier than our others but it tracks like a dream, it’s stable and does great in our river, bay flat water adventures.","I have worked at REI Anchorage for 13 years in the paddling department. I was writing up the received boat paperwork and decided to buy this boat before I even got the paperwork done. The fabric is much higher quality that what it appears to be in the picture, great coated ripstop. The way the seams are sealed makes it look like a pool toy but are solid. (If they used the same glue on the boat as they used on the box the thing is never going to come apart.) Plenty of room in it for a tall paddler and some gear. I'm planning to use it as a travel boat to take to Hawaii and Mexico to snorkel out of. Not as rugged as the Alpackas but 1/5th the price, and how many of us really need an Alpacka? Wouldn't put my dog in it but wouldn't put him in an Alpacka either. If you want an inflatable dog boat, get the Aire. I have that one, too. Easy to inflate (does requite a foot pump, my bag pump from the Alpacka didn't provide enough pressure so you do have to carry a pump with you), and comfortable. Obviously I haven't gotten it into the water yet but as soon as I can drop it in Westchester without it landing on 2 feet of ice, I'll update my review.",,,,,,,,,,"I've been following Oru for a while now, ever since their appearance on Shark Tank a few years back.

I am happy to report that is everything I thought it would be and more. Easy to put together, plenty of room, fun for a casual paddle and easy to store.

,I've had this for 4 years and I absolutely love it! My family always has a blast and we've had fun exploring different lakes. This kyak is comfortable and easy for my kids to handle as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],,,I bought two of these for my family of four. The kayaks worked exactly as advertised. Very stable in the water and drew a straight line through the water. It handled great even fighting the wind and waves on the lake. I did buy the backbones for the kayaks which indeed helped performance. The cases are great. Of course these are a bit heavy but then you feel the quality. Both kayaks in the cases fit in the trunk under the bed of my Ridgeline which was a surprise. This was much more convenient then two hard shell double kayaks on the roof of my truck. I could not be happier with the product.,"I have been wanting to purchase a kayak to add a new dimension to my workouts. I have lost some upper body strength since I am in my 50's now and wanted to work on that. I have had a canoe before, but had never kayaked. I read about it and decided to go with this one. Very happy that I did. There are two things that I would change about this kayak, hence the 4 star review instead of 5. I would have liked the handle by the cockpit to be open for wrap around grasping and the feet rests to be slightly larger. I can deal with the thin seat padding buy putting down seat pad. The reason for the handle change is because I am only 5'2"" and it would be easier for me to lift this kayak onto my carrier. I have a Subaru Outback and need to stand on a step stool to get the kayak mounted. I have arthritis in my thumbs so my grasp isn't as strong as it use to be. Slightly larger foot rests would be more comfortable. I am really pleased with this kayak as far as handling goes. Happy that it came with paddle since I don't have enough experience to know what I would have wanted. I have used this kayak on a lake and the Missouri River and was very happy with the performance. I plan on purchasing one for my husband.",I bought this kayak a while back and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Great kayak. You can use it for anything. I would recommend this to anybody for their first kayak or their 50th kayak.,,,"Love the kayaks, great stability and easy load and unload.",,A buddy of mine bought this kayak. The drive unit is very poorly designed. It's hard to peddle. Under power it can pop out of its retainer bracket. The manufacturer told him the prop should be tightened every 30m! Needless to say he returned it. There are better kayaks out there. I'd avoid this one.,"I've always wanted to kayak but transporting one limited me. The Oru has afforded me opportunities to go whenever and wherever I want! After a few practice sessions, setting up and taking down is easy. From trunk of the car to the water only takes me about 10 minutes. I'm 5'6 and can very easily lift the kayak fully assembled. The Beach LT is great for flatwater paddling! I'm very happy with my choice of the Oru Beach LT!",,"I purchased the Delta 12.10 in the spring of 2017 after retiring to Cape Cod, and have been using it this summer on its bays, lakes and rivers. I was looking for a light kayak that I (a 65 year-old medium-sized man) could hoist on and off of my car, and to and from the water, and that could handle bay-sized waves without dumping me out. On those two scores, the Delta 12.10 passes the test. It is light - I can carry it quite a ways, and getting it on and off of my car is fairly easy. In the bays, the keel design, with a sort of built-in rudder, keeps a straight course, although In rivers it is less nimble on turns. The knife-edged bow cuts through waves cleanly. The cockpit is smaller than average, making it a little more difficult to get in and out of, but it also helps keep the waves out. It is stable in the water and in waves, although a little tippy getting in and out of. I don't use the two large sealed compartments for storage, but I am glad they are there for buoyancy in case I turn it over. I also like having the bow lines along the edge of the deck in case I need to grab them from the water. Perhaps the most useful feature is the small hatch in front of the cockpit, which holds my phone, etc. within easy reach. On the downside, I don’t necessarily have a bad back, but the seat back is brutally uncomfortable for me. No matter how I adjust it, it presses me in the mid-back like an iron bar. I wound up putting a seat cushion against the seat back, plus a smaller lumbar pillow, which mostly fixes the problem. Also, the supposedly sealed compartments each take on a spoon-full of water, which is annoying to dry out. If you want a light kayak with safety features (also buy a paddle-float) that can handle bay-sized waves, I can recommend the 12.10, but check out that seat back first.",,,,"I have a Delta 14s which is labeled ""new"" on the manufacturer's label and may not be the same kayak as being sold by REI. I purchased it 1 month ago. I requested information by e-mail from Delta on whether the 14s is a new model and also of the weight of the kayak which is listed as 42 pounds. I mentioned that I was hoping to do a review of this kayak but wanted to make sure I was reviewing the same boat. No response from Delta. This may not be the same kayak.
Two previously tested 14 feet kayaks by popular manufacturers seemed sluggish to me.
I have paddled more than 50 miles on this kayak all on lakes -- small and relatively large on the eastern side of the Canadian Rockies, mostly in choppy waters and with gusts up to 25mph. I have not tested it in rivers, but some of these lakes are created and therefore still have submerged logs which one has to maneuver around, sometimes quickly. I have not used the rudder at all in order to get the feel of the boat without rudder. Rudder is standard with this kayak.
Previous commentor is probably taller and with longer legs than mine. I am 5' tall, with short legs. I have found many longer kayaks to be made for taller people; height, girth and leg length matters.
On the previous evaluation: 1) Agree that the boat glides well, even in choppy water with fetch, facing or with the wind. 2) It is stable in cross waves and deep troughs (2'). 3) Compared to my other 12'8"" also plastic boat, this cut through the waves more than floats -- although that may be a relative issue. It behaves well in waves. Because it has more exposure to water resistance in these conditions, more effort is required when paddling a boat which ""floats"" over a boat which cuts through a wave (my own analysis). ""Effort"" is also a relative term -- I am used to paddling consistently, not stop and go as some paddlers are prone to do, and the extra effort I mention above is not taxing at all, requires more conscious paddling than normal. 4) I have no way to weigh the boat, but it seems much lighter than my other thermoformed plastic kayak (12'8"" long - 38 pounds with additional 5 pounds of gear in hatches). 5) The seat took some getting used to. I liked the adjustable seat because on all kayaks my short legs made adjustment difficult (I have had to put hard foam extensions on my other plastic kayak pedals). I am now comfortable with the seat. 6) The cockpit opening is just fine for someone with shorter legs; width is also good for entering and exit. 7) The keyhole cockpit opening to accommodate the thigh braces does not impede my getting in or getting out and actually makes bracing much more natural. 8) The previous note about bow and stern lines should be noted by Delta -- she is correct. 9) Ditto the day hatch -- it has become less difficult to remove the cover and tighten it with use, but I cannot remove it while in the kayak, much less secure it. I carry my SPOT and waterproof palm sized camera with me and I attach both on the bungee lines. I use the small front hatch only to hold my car keys and wallet, which I don't need while on the water. I don't think that adds to the kayak, but neither does it take up space which is not usable. The regular front hatch is already closer to leg adjustment bars than many other kayaks and even without the front small gear hatch, it would be difficult to put even a small duffle there, even for someone who uses the closest to the seat setting of leg pegs. In my case, since I adjust my seat forward closest to the pedals setting, I have sufficient room behind my backrest for lunch, water, snacks, even a compressed jacket. 10) If you camp while paddling, as we do, the large capacity hatches are a plus, but I have not yet tested it to see whether it carries our normal 44 pounds of gear, clothes, water and food per kayak. 11) Exterior coating and color. Unlike my other thermofoamed kayak which has great color and which resists dust very well, Delta could use some work on exterior coating and colors. The coating, even when treated with 303, does not resist dust -- in fact it seems to attract road dust which cannot be easily wiped off. Color does matter if one is doing long paddles and my new kayak's orange is opaque and like food which sits on your stomach -- heavy. My other thermoformed plastic kayak's color dances in sun which I appreciate while taking a break on water. 12) Regarding the ""softness"" of the exterior, I beg to differ. My other plastic kayak is even ""softer"" and it has gone over fast running rivers on shoals (on the Brule in Wisconsin), hit cypress knees, boulders, dragged over concrete landings for over 4,000 miles and still paddles as well as when I bought it. The Delta, by the press test used by the previous paddler, is less ""soft"", but I am not sure that this is a good test of durability of material. 13) I would add that it seems to track well without rudder -- something I consider very important. 14) Also, it is easy to maneuver, another important point for me.
I have given the Delta 14s, paddled only 50 miles, a 4 star because I have not yet tested it with rudder and have not tested it for maneuverability under river conditions (which I will get a chance in a month). Also I am just now getting used to the craft -- it is 1' 4"" longer than my other plastic boat and narrower, requiring a slight adjustment in paddling.",,,,"I have been kayaking for 3 years. My addiction started when my partner got two yaks in an estate buyout. Mine was a Perception America which is a awesome touring kayak but weighs in at 87 pounds. I am 54 and weigh 120 so lugging my boat around had become an impediment. In my search for a lighter weight boat, I naturally started with the perception line because I like my America so much. But when I saw the skylark lifting up on the rack I knew it was the boat for me. It is a 12 foot boat and tracks and turns well. It moved through the water well and handles choppy water with ease. And it looks fantastic! It is so sleek that you can’t help but turn your head to look at it on the water. One last thing. My former boat was this thick, composite plastic, and used when I got it, so I never much worried about running up on boat ramps and the like. The thought of scratches or gouges on my skylark made me cringe, so I did buy keelguard which I have placed along the bottom of the boat to protect.",,,,,,,,,,,,"I did a lot of research only to be let down. I ordered it and it was delivered to the REI store. I tested the skeg. It wouldn't drop. The slot the skeg rests in isn't wide enough for the skeg and the cord tied to it. As a result, the skeg gets wedged in the slot when it's pulled up. Dagger has to either widen the slot, or find a thinner cord to tie to the skeg. I had to leave the kayak behind and asked for a refund.","We bought the PackLite because of the weight and size to carry by hand and in our vehicle. We tried it on our lake 2 days. Without a rudder, it does not track well. We saw no way to rig a homemade rudder. I could not do my power strokes without causing a wobble. Instead I had to do very shallow strokes.",,,,,,,,,,I had to return it. I liked that it allowed my wife and I to get out on the water. Unfortunately at the price point of this boat I couldn’t justify keeping it. I was constantly fighting it to go in the direction I wanted. Every time I folded it up it was beating itself up. We are currently looking at other options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Boat got wider (a and slower). The 2017 version was a better design at 28"" wide. Would be good for fishing, but paddling is more ""dead yak"" like.",,,,
,We borrowed this a few times last summer from a friend along with their paddle board from lifetime. We just purchased a kayak and soon we'll have a paddleboard. Our whole family loves them!,,,"We just got this kayak last week and could not wait to try it out. First weekend and we had it on the Deep River in North Carolina. A rare product that performs EXACTLY as advertised. Even though the REI store staff was a little lukewarm to the boat, we purchased it based on all the great reviews here and other places. Well, my wife and I love it. Very stable, easy to inflate (follow the instructions!!) and easy to break-down afterward. Very stable (although we only used on a calm river with a few Class I rapids) so far. Also, the kayak tracks well and seems pretty efficient. I have paddled Old Town Dirigo's in tidal creeks for compare. Next trip is to use in salt marshes and tidal creeks behind Bald Head Island NC.","My wife and I recently purchased 2 of these and love them. They're stable and have plenty of room for a cooler/towels in the back. Molded handles are great and the kayaks are fairly lightweight to carry, again great product!","Bought a pair of these in May after looking for the best smaller over-night boat for my husband and I. Both of us are tall and also needed a higher weight capacity. Chose these over the Dagger Axis because of the higher weight capacity and superior seats. Extremely happy with them. Upsides: They track pretty decently even with the skeg up, but fly like an arrow with it down, and are surprisingly nimble when in tight spots. EXTREMELY stable boats, both primary and secondary stability is excellent. Seats are extremely comfortable once you familiarize yourself with them (it can be a bit complicated at 1st, Wilderness Systems has a great video for dialing in your cockpit on their website). Enough room for my husband's 275 lb 6'1"" frame and size 15 feet with room to spare. Enough room in hatch to allow for some light overnight camping as well. Downsides: need a high angle paddle if you want to get this thing moving fast. Had small problem with a ballast leak in 1 boat, but W.S. fixed it immediately without hesitation or complaint. Weighs in at 50 lbs-might be heavy for some people to lift.",,,This is my first kayak and was really surprised at how sturdy it was. has plenty of space to carry all your nessecaties and a lot of room to add things to it!,,Warning - do not buy this. We lost our propeller after only using it 7 times and the company cannot replace it. Have to buy a whole new unit for about $945 . You would think a company could make a simple propeller but they do not.,"My husband and I did tons of research on a variety of kayaks before deciding to purchase Oru. We live in an apartment in Seattle and didn't know where we would store a kayak. We also wanted to be able to easily kayak on a whim without a lot of planning on days where we unexpectedly get a lot of sun and want to go for a quick paddle after work. These have been perfect for all of that. After close to 10 uses in different areas, I've had no issues with leaks and assembly is pretty simple. I will say that this kayak cannot be assembled by one person at the beginning. I'm hoping that will change as I break it in more, but it's still a bit stuff and I need another person to get the first snap done when putting together. After practice, I usually get it assembled within 10 minutes, and even less time when putting it back together.
I'm 5'4'', 120 lbs and this is heavy for me. If we park far away and have to walk a little bit, I usually have bruising on my shoulders the next day from where the straps were. It's difficult for me to trek more than a couple of minutes in bag or kayak form. I may invest in the backpack to see if that helps.
Overall, this is an excellent option for a quick and easy way to get on the water without bothering with a roof rack. It also easily fits into closets. I love the open cockpit, gives me tons of room. This is the only kayak I've owned or used so I can't compare to anything else, but I find it to be very stable and flows well. I have been told by people who own the Beach that if it flips, it will sink. I'll be purchasing the float bags that Our offers, but plan on practicing flipping it once it's warmer out and would recommend anyone who purchases this practice that in case it really does sink and you're far from land.",,"Of the many kayaks I have purchased through REI in past years, the Delta 12.10 kayak is in an entirely different class. It is superior to the others of similar length and even longer in design, features, structure, and performance. Esthetically, it is just a beautiful boat. And, I thought the other boats ranged from very good to excellent in the above categories.
It has quite good primary and secondary stability as well as excellent rough water performance - depending on the skills of the paddler. The hybrid ABS materials and thoughtful engineering design make for a sophisticated, functional, and rugged craft. An especially attractive feature is the unique method of sealing the storage holds. The day hold just ahead of the cockpit is very useful in that you don't have to beach the boat in order to reach the things you often need while paddling (e.g., drinks, snack bars, lunch, glasses, camera, etc.)
It has enough storage for a week long, or longer, tours - I tend to leave the TV, desktop computer, Keurig coffee maker and electric blanket at home, but not the wine. It has at least twice the storage volume of the backpacks I have used for 10+ day backcountry hiking and ski touring adventures. In all, the Delta 12.10 kayak offers a unique touring boat experience with long term rewards and the opportunity for enriching adventures.",,,,"I purchased the Delta 14 but can really only claim to have demoed it. I returned it after paddling it once because of the seat and other problems in and around the cockpit.
PROS: In quiet water the Delta 14 paddles very well. I’ve owned or demoed the Delta 12, 14, 14.5, and 15.5. Out of that group, the 14 shines for its great glide. Tracking was fine in a light wind. I didn’t get a chance to paddle it in rough water, but I would expect the 14 to be very stable because it has the same flared bow as other Deltas, which translates to great buoyancy to carry you up over waves.
Like the other Deltas, the 14 has a ton of volume for your camping gear––over 200 liters.
CONS While the Delta hull shape is great, I found that the 14 falls short in several other areas. At this price point I would expect the details to be well thought out, and I found that they just weren’t.
1) The weight of the 14 is incorrectly listed just about everywhere on the internet, including Delta’s own website. I asked Delta to weigh it with the rudder and they reported that it weighs 46 lbs, not 42 lbs. Those four extra pounds mean a lot to kayakers, especially at this price. They also change how buyers compare Delta to the competition, since it’s hard to make a 42-lb 14’ kayak in thermoformed plastic. I hope Delta and REI will revise their specs, since the rudder is standard on this kayak.
2) The 2013 Delta seat was quite good––stable, comfortable. This year’s new seat I would rate as very poor and a deal breaker. The support that allows the seat to slide back and forth intrudes well into the center of the cockpit, exactly where you want to put your foot for getting in the kayak. The seat pan is quite deep, giving an illusion of leg support, but it’s way too low in the front to provide actual leg support. It didn’t even touch my legs in the front. The seat back is flimsy, made of thin plastic and attached to the post that holds it up with a very small rubber line. It slipped down out of position several times and I couldn’t get it back up while on the water.
3) I found the cockpit wide enough but too short, making exit difficult. The length of the cockpit is more typical of a sea kayak, while the Delta 14 is in the transitional class.
4) It’s quite difficult to attach bow and stern lines to this kayak as there is nothing secure to hold them. There are two steel security loops––which can normally be used for bow and stern lines––but they’re located near the cockpit.
5) The day hatch is convenient, but it takes up valuable storage space in the cockpit. I had difficulty sliding my medium-sized duffel under it. The duffel contains items I need on the water (clothing, food, water) that won’t fit in a day hatch or that you don’t want in a day hatch (food on a hot day). To accommodate tall paddlers the front bulkhead is placed rather far forward, reducing the storage space in the front hatch. This makes the space at the front of the cockpit valuable real estate for storage.
6) The cockpit rim is quite small in diameter, making it difficult to grasp the kayak safely by the rim to lift it. Unlike most thermoformed kayaks, the rim is molded in.
7) The Delta 14 comes standard with a rudder. A well-designed 14’ kayak shouldn’t need a rudder, and I doubt that the Delta 14 needs one. The rudder adds to the weight and the price.
8) Sorry to get too picky, but the Delta colors are a bit jarring: orange red, lime green, and egg yolk yellow.
In passing, Delta’s plastic and/or construction is somewhat soft. You will feel this if you press down in front of and behind the cockpit.
SUMMARY Delta got it right with the main priority: the hull design. But at this price point there are several other things that need to be right as well, and I think the Delta 14 needs some more design work. For me the seat and short cockpit were unworkable. Otherwise I might have kept this kayak. I think Delta sacrificed the quality of the seat in the quest to keep the weight of the kayak down and be more competitive.
I’m giving the Delta 14 two stars because of the seat and other problems in the cockpit area. It could easily be redesigned into a 4–5-star kayak, since the hull is right.",,,,"It’s comfortable and light, I have zero complaints!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My husband and I are huge fans of tandem kayaks so naturally, we were excited to find out that Oru was coming out with a tandem model. I've always wanted to try an Oru single but could never justify it. The annual REI sale and warmer weather gave us the perfect excuse to give this one a go, but unfortunately it fell quite short of what we expected out of a kayak at this price point. Our main takeaways:
Pros: It's really fast. With two paddlers perfectly in sync, this was as fast as, if not faster than a hardshell kayak. That was definitely unexpected since we were expecting a boat of this width to generally have more drag in the water. After figuring out how to put it together the first time, it's really quite easy to assemble on the spot. We brought a large tarp to lay down during assembly to avoid scratching the boat, and would recommend doing that as it looks to be an easy boat to damage if you're not careful. We both marveled at how clever the design was, with buckle placements that served multiple purposes depending on what you needed it to do. The assembly and disassembly are color-coded, so it doesn't take a lot to figure out at all. It's also amazingly lightweight. I'm very weak with almost no upper body strength, and it made me feel like a superhero to be able to pick this up by myself if I needed to. With two people carrying this at each end, it was featherlight. You wouldn't expect something this light to be seaworthy.
Cons: On that same note, this is the dealbreaker for us. We paddled on a very small pond, in relatively calm conditions, and going back to shore was a struggle of epic proportions. The wind had picked up slightly and it constantly knocked the boat sideways despite our best efforts. This wasn't a strong gust by any means--it didn't even disturb the water on the pond. But even with perfectly still conditions, the boat we were paddling didn't track straight for some reason. We confirmed that we were both sitting dead center, brought it back to shore and reassembled everything, and still couldn't figure it out. It skewed slightly to the left, and as the front paddler I was course correcting almost the whole time. It also sits deeper in the water than we would have liked, with the water at hip level to slightly above hip level. My husband is around 180 lbs and I am 100 lbs, so we were by no means heavy people. I'm not sure how much deeper it would sit in the water with a heavier pair, and the idea is alarming. I think this boat would really benefit from float bags at the bow and stern, which I've read is something they include with their single models. (But not this one? Why?)
I'm not sure what we were expecting out of a folding kayak, but the laws of physics definitely apply. It actually does feel like you're sitting in a cardboard box on the middle of a body of water, which is honestly not reassuring at all. Stability is not as good as expected considering the width of the boat. In addition, after just two folds, my husband and I have observed that some of the folds are already showing a bit of fraying at the edges. Despite the claim of how many folds it's rated for, we weren't all that confident that this boat would last more than 5 years, much less a decade. And honestly, the product photo showing the woman and the dog for scale is misleading. It's huge in person. The woman and dog must be very tall/large in real life and they must've chosen them for that shoot for how small it makes the kayak look. Keep in mind that this is coming from a short couple though. I'm 5'3"" and my husband is 5'6"" and there is NO way we can carry this thing around on just the shoulder strap for any distance longer than from the parking lot to the pond.
For us, the cons far outweigh the pros. Maybe I would have tempered my expectations if I had tried their single model. In my opinion, this might be a dream kayak for someone who lives in a small space, and who is desperate for a fast, lightweight kayak to paddle with their dog or small child. It's not for us at all, and I suspect it's not for the majority of couples looking to own a tandem. Then again, everyone is different. If you think the cons are a good tradeoff for the admittedly incredible convenience, then by all means, try it for yourself. But for us, we simply could not justify those shortcomings considering the cost of the boat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I loved the seat on this kayak. Very comfortable and allows you to stay out on the water longer. It also goes very quick and holds a pretty straight line while paddling. Great product!,,,"Purchased the kayak back in 2007 and used it on a number of lakes and rivers including Russian, Sacramento and Colorado rivers. The Russian River had thrown a few surprises in a form of an extreme low water and an infinite number of class II (some of them were closer to class III) rapids. The kayak had demonstrated very good maneuverability, stability and smooth tracking.
pros: * versatility -- if used in a solo mode, the kayak provides tons of cargo space enough to accommodate a 4 to 5-day trip; * compactness -- when deflated and folded, fits inside of even a small car; no additional accessories required (such as rooftop rails, crossbars, foam pads and so on) * durability -- the outer shell is made of a very durable materials; after a number of adventures the bottom of my kayak shows no scratches at all
contras: * a bit heavy for its class * seats(!!!) definitely need some improvement * accessories (especially the back-bone frame) appear to be overpriced; actually, the back-bone frame and the upper deck (both variants)should not be accessories at all - they should come with the kayak",Great boat. Very stable even on mild rivers. Easy to transport and store.,"Purchased new Wilderness System Aspire 105 kayak during annual REI spring sale using 2015 dividend. Disappointed we could not use 20% off one item coupon for purchase. I have same kayak and purchasing another kayak for the wife. Anticipate one month back order which also disappoints since we miss majority of spring float opportunities. I do enjoy the kayak and is a nice cross between river/lake floats, fishing, and other aqua activities. REI has always been great to us and will patiently await delivery.",,,"I bought this kayak based on posted and YouTube reviews. This kayak is well built and extremely comfortable to sit in. I fished for about 4 hours and could have gone longer.
A couple negatives and disappointments. First this kayak is not as stable as advertised or claimed. Can you stand up in this kayak? Can people walk a tight rope at the circus? Yes, but only people with great balance and agility. No, this kayak is far from stable enough to stand in and fish. That's OK if you knew that before buying it. The problem is trying to maneuver in the seat so you can reach gear that is stored behind the seat without flipping. Yes, it has a nice 5"" hull hatch for storage. No, it doesn't come with a dry bag. Good luck reaching it while sitting in the kayak.
You're going to need a kayak cart or or a friend to carry it, or you'll be dragging it everywhere you go. 57 lbs is light enough until you add some gear. Forget dragging it on the keel block. It will tip over and you'll drag it on its side.
I like the kayak overall but the stability issue on the water is my biggest complaint. The kayak tracks very well and is easy to paddle.
The battery box for a fish finder, the scupper whole for wires including a molded indentation for a transducer is brilliant.
Some people don't like the built-in pole holders. I actually like them. They are great for mounting pole-holder holders or can be used mount outriggers for stability which is my next project.",,,"I love the idea of this kayak. We live in an apartment and our choices are limited due to storage constraints. I love how light it is as well. However, it does seem a bit difficult to put together. Especially the front hull. I have to hold it with my legs straddling the kayak and I can just barely get the strap into the ratcheting device to tighten it up. The front snaps just barely fit as well. Once the seat is in and holds the sides together, the rear is much easier to put together. There is no way that my wife could do this, she doesn't have the hand or arm strength. Also, on only the 5th time using it, the front ratchet fell out rendering the kayak useless. Without that holding it together, it's just a weird shaped piece of plastic. I felt that this was very expensive considering the cheap materials with which it is made. The snaps seem cheap and likely to break sometime soon and the front ratchet has already fallen off on it's 5th use. The boat seems like it is made from the same material that plastic mail totes are made of. I would say that this is more of a $400 kayak than $1,200. Three times what it's worth. The plastic may be able to be unfolded 10,000 times as they claim, but their hardware is only good for 4 uses.",,"I like this kayak for heavier conditions that require more of a sea kayak frame and design. Nice light weight compared to mybothers, glossy paint is nice, straps and cords are good. The cockpit is tight so some may feel cramped, material is delicate so need to be careful in rocky waters. Overall, good kayak. REI staff was really helpful",,,,"Have used the Delta 14 for about 3 years.No problems with hardware.seals or rudder.Still my favorite,"" do everything"" boat!",,,,"I had one of these for a few months and ultimately traded for a real sea kayak due to insufficient design and the overall cost of this boat.
On the plus side, the boat is light and stiff, it's very responsive when you put a stroke in and it's one of the lightest boats I've picked up. There is plenty of storage capacity and it is comfortable and stable to a point.
Where you have to question this boat's price point, value, and design is in it's intended uses. This is a recreational boat, not a sea kayak. A fully fledged sea kayak will be safe for open water and longer distances from shore, however this boat is not either of those things. Once rolled over, the boat takes considerable work to right for self rescue and the cockpit volume is excessive, filling with a large quantity of water that takes a long time to pump out. When filled, the cockpit sits so low to the waterline that any wave or water movement will cause it to re-fill and mean you bobbing around in the water longer than you should be. Rolling the boat would take considerable effort.
The most critical flaw is the hatch design. During a self rescue, I put my hand on the cover of the hatch on accident and pushed down, the hatch popped open and began flooding with water. I managed to salvage it by dragging it to shore, but this is unacceptable in a any boat that cost $1400.
So you have to ask where this boat fits in. For the cost, you could buy a true roto sea kayak that has greater stability and recovery potential, along with better design, which would be less limiting. On other hand, you could buy a cheaper rec boat that is of similar design, just a bit heavier due to being roto. Personally, I can't find where this boat fits in outside of just being an overpriced rec boat or a bad sea kayak. In any case, don't do what I did and expect to be buying a light duty sea kayak: it's not that at all, it's a rec boat and one with mediocre design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We bought this for my son to use at college. Easy to transport. Took him about 30min to assemble the first time, about 10min second time. Easy to handle and easy to fish from. He has used it in lakes only at this point.

Made a few necessary adds like anchor trolley and and hook,,,"Pros: Roomy cockpit. Lightweight. Fairly easy to put together.
Cons: I agree completely with another reviewer. The ratchet system at the stern and bow are a pain to assemble. It's a feat of strength to get the ratchet to engage and the strap is not nearly long enough.
From an aesthetic perspective, the beach kayak is beautifully designed. I get compliments every time I'm out on the water.
Would I recommend this kayak? Yes. I have a compact car, and transporting this is a dream.",,"Picked up my Delta 6/15/19.This is a sweet, quality kayak, love it Used mainly on rivers and Florida's west coast bays and intracoastals.it's light, easy to paddle, tracks well and has plenty of storage.Though many folks are using SOT fishing kayaks, I'm still partial to the traditional sit ins.This is nicest boat I've ever owned.",,,,"I am 5ft 5inches tall and this boat adjusts to fit myself or my husband who is 6ft tall and has a 34 inch inseam.Stable boat with great hull design and speed.A camp trails cot will slide in the front and an rei stowaway chair will go in the back,easily leaving enough room for multi night trips.The rudder is unnecessary, so it is easily removed to get the weight down to 41lbs.Buy it..you will not regret it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"We have have taken our out a few times - what a great Kayak, I would recommend this Kayak to anyone - Great Price Amazing Quality! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",,,"Purchased the Advanced Elements from REI in 2004, no problems and the support from the Advanced Elements is outstanding. The boat travels well, ours has gone to the San Juan Islands, Kauai, HI (checked Bags), Vancouver Island, and all points in between.
Uses, rivers (Willamette), ocean (Na Pali Kauai, HI) (Orca Island), lakes (Detroit, Clear, Hosmer, Suttle) to name just a few. This boat tracks well in five foot plus swells (Na Pali Coast) to heavy winds at Detroit Lake, with not even a hint of instability. We have not flipped or had to get back into this boat ever. The two of us can easily paddle this boat at 3.5 mph without a great deal of strain (tracked by GPS flat water). We are both senior citizens in average shape so this boat will meet the needs of any age group in our opinion.
The benefit we like off the water is storage. Fits nicely into trunk of car and stores well in corner of garage. Setup is easy, just carry boat in bag to water, inflate and enjoy. Much better then lugging a heavy 14 ft plus boat off of rack.
Only negative is the boat gets wet, well anything on water does that, you just have to make sure boat is dried completely before bagging. Not a big issue for us as we just inflate the main chambers allowing boat to dry in the sun or turned over if rain is insight.
Recommend the backbone option as it improves tracking and eliminates flexing in heavy swells. We used the boat for three years without this option (not available when purchased) and the boat did very well in Kauai, HI. Still recommend the option for most users.
Great boat, fun, easy to use and we would highly recommend to all.","I am 6' 190 lbs.Sold my sit-in,wanted something more comfortable. I am 73. This Kayak is great! Super comfortable and very solid lower back support. When you want to go fast the back support and feet braces are terrific. It is steady and feels very safe.",I like this kayak as it handles well in the class l and 2 rivers where I kayak the most in Missouri. It handles well and is reasonably light weight. The skeg that’s drops down helps on flat water. It doesn’t hold as much as I would have liked as I like to kayak camp on the gravel bars.,,,I got these kayacks last month and they are very stable,,,Viewed 2016 ORU Beach at REI store with sales person and was satisfied with demo. Purchased a 2017 Beach LT and design changed from 2016 model and is difficult to assemble and ORU not willing to work with us to resolve problem. Would not recommend purchasing ORU 2017 Beach LT 2017.,,"Unhappy that one of the bungee cords in a handle broke just he second time using this kayak.
Not light enough to load onto my truck and get in the water by myself but easily maneuverable once launched.
Have been having lots of fun exploring our lake.",,,,"Comfortable, good tracking on barnegat bay in NJ. Easy to paddle. Great seat, nice length Is a keeper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This boat is not very stable, doesn’t track that great, and the seat is completely ornamental.",,,"Compact, folds easily to get into bag. Fits in the back of a SUV or car with large trunk easily. Takes about 3 minutes to pump up and into the water. Easy to deflate with the pump also. Very sturdy, have gotten out of it in the middle of the lake and back in without worry of it tipping over. Looks very nice. Fits 2 people very comfortably. Only tiny drawback is it is hard to get it completey dry on the inside. We let it sit on patio when we get home until completely dry before storing away in the bag.","I needed a kayak that a:could handle a toddler for a year. b: stay flat on flat lake water c: carry something d: comfort e; no nylon handles f; bonus fishing rod holders.
This kayak is everything i wanted. very comfortable seat back. I didnt want a strap\plastic style latch that could break. 2nd time on this kayak and I did close to 4 miles on it. not the least bit tired. boat is not wishy washy, in that you can keep a straight line pretty well, it upset my kids with how fast i was compared their boats",,,,"I bought it for seat comfort and was worried it might be slow and cumbersome on the river, but it handled the river fine. It moves faster than I thought it would for a wide boat and was very stable in the water. I would give it a 5 if it were lighter. I got wheels for it, but it is still kind of heavy to move around when out of the water.",,,"I bought the fold up Oru ""beach"" kayak because I wanted to be able to go kayaking without needing help getting a boat on and off my truck. This kayak goes together in about 5 minutes, it weighs 26 pounds so it's very easy to carry around, and it folds up into its own box which fits in the back seat of a car. The boat also handles very well and is beautiful. The cockpit is roomy and easy to get in and out of. I couldn't be more pleased that I made the decision to buy this boat.",,"I bought this kayak about a month ago and since I've tested its abilities is all kind of waters: inland calm lake, slow river and open water.
Starting with the way it looks, it is an beautiful boat which seems to be made with a lot of attention to every detail, and has features found on more expensive kayaks. The seat and the foot braces are adjustable and it's worth spending some time to adjust them for your own body, as it is hard to make any adjustments while on water.
The kayak only weights a little over 40 lb, and I've been able to load and unload on/from the top of our SUV by myself.
Handling is great. It tracks pretty well and also it is easy to turn. After taking it in the lake nearby, with calm water and occasional small waves, I was really curios to see what it can do in a more challenging environment, so I put the kayak in one of the Great Lakes where I was faced with 3 ft waves and some wind. It was the most fun I had in a while. Excellent stability, while I was able to paddle in any direction I wanted. Could've used a spray skirt at times, as occasional waives entered in the boat, but overall the kayak behaved wonderfully.
Inspecting the built in storage at the end of the day, I found some water which wasn't there at the beginning of the day. Not sure how it got there, but I don't think it will be a big issue for me.
The inconvenience I had is not related to the kayak, but to the retailer, which cancelled my order about a week later, and I had to go thru a series of email and phone communications, to reinstate the order. Billing was also wrong and they had to mail me a check for true-up. I wanted to subtract a star from the rating, but would've been unfair for the manufacturer which has done a great job. Also, I really wanted this particular kayak due to the reviews I red and it is only sold by one retailer in my state.
Also, there are only two colors offered. I was wondering why not available colors on the manufacturer's website are offered in store.
All together I recommend this product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Every experience with Lifetime products and customer service has been positive and pleasant!,,,"Sure it's a hassle drying it out after you use it, but other than that I couldn't be happier! After 100+ miles of the Russian River, many tranquil days on Tomales Bay and Drakes Estero, Lake Tahoe during both summer and winter and pushing its limits on the intense rapids of the Truckee River, I can say these are tough boats that should last a long time if properly cared for.","I’ve had this kayak for about a month now and I absolutely love it! I’ve taken it down The Lower Salt River here in AZ and more recently, Willow Springs Lake up north. I have two little boys and can fit them nicely (I am 5 foot, 130lbs). At one point, I had two kiddos, myself AND my mini Aussie heeler on this kayak! My mini Aussie heeler is a little sketch ball and we didn’t tip over, which made me love the kayak even more! I’m able to carry it with ease as well. I did add a paddle holder to the side and am looking to actually add an adjustable seat because I like sitting a little more upright in some cases. Overall, it’s a great kayak! Even my husband likes it and pointed out that it’s more stable than the previous one we owned (he’s 5’ 11” and about 190lbs).",,,,"I love my pescador pro10, Cons- I don’t like the side carry handles and It is way to unstable to fish from a standing position. Pros - it is very stable from any of the seat positions and is easy to maneuver and it tracks well. The recessed area to place a transponder and the storage compartment is great for a fish finder.",,,"I bought this kayak specifically because it folds up and will fit in my car. I was a little hesitant because of how long it took some people that I talked to and in the reviews that I have read, however this is a worry no longer. I set it up and took it down for the first time in about 30 min. That is set up and take down. I wanted to get a feel for it before I took it to the lake. It was super simple and really intuitive; the arrows and target marks on the kayak really helped when I went to fold it up.
I haven't tested it on water yet but I expect it to be awesome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"We spent 5 hours on the Chesapeake Bay yesterday (put in at Chesapeake Beach, MD) in this kayak and we had a great time. We are probably ""classified"" as casual paddlers, but we were out with a friend on a rigid single kayak. He runs a youth center and takes the kids out canoeing and kayaking often, so he's our expert. He was impressed with our kayak. We chose an inflatable because we wanted one we could put in my SUV, not on top.
Here are a few observations: 1. We realize it's an inflatable kayak so we didn't expect it to be even ""almost"" rigid. We didn't buy the backbone initially and although we didn't ""need"" it yesterday, I plan to get one before we go out again. The kayak is very good and I think the backbone will make it better. 2. This kayak has fabric covering the inner air tube so be aware that you're not going to be able to easily dry it. We towel dried everything we could and then left the kayak out overnight so the fabric parts could dry. 3. I've read bad reviews about needing a special pump to inflate the kayak. We bought the double action hand pump, but we also used the electric pump that came with one of our inflatable mattresses. The trick is, don't expect the nozzle to fit like they were made for each other. Put the valve in the deflate position and use the nozzle that fits snugly. Expect to hold it in place. It doesn't seem like it will work, but it actually works quite well. It's also all explained in the manual. 4. I like the convertible feature. The ability to go from double to single and add the skirting?? (sorry, I'm new...) make it a versatile boat.
The picture shows the kayak deflated and drying.","Bought a couple months ago for my wife and she loves it. I've used it too on several occassions and it's a nice boat for all around use. I am 185lbs 5'11"" (& my butt stays dry). While not a speedy craft, it's very stable and fun to fish from given the two rod holders. At about 9.5ft long it stores well vertically/upright in our shed. Easy haul for road trips, this boat isnt heavy and easily placed/racked on top of our suv with a couple tie downs. Get off your ""shore"" and paddle.",,,,when seat is on top position makes unsable and tips over easy,,,"Bought the Oru Beach with intent of taking on road trips with the packed up size and weight being the main draw for us. Assembly was easy once I saw the trick to getting the hull straps out of the way of the snaps fitting together. Just a clever boat, we really wanted to like it.
However after two test trips on local waters we never felt as safe and stable compared to our old 17 1/2 ft folding nor our 12 ft inflatable kayaks. Those are both very hard to tip to the point of water entering the cockpit, not so with the very open cockpit in the Oru Beach. That was a concern for our intended use in open lake waters under 50F. Perhaps one of the other Oru models would have been more suited.
The foot bar was very frustrating. It's not fixed to the hull but suspended by straps and frequently slipped off my feet so I could not “lock” myself in place to get better boat control. Had to pay attention when shifting body position and even how hard I paddled to avoid dipping the hull to far to one side and shipping water into the cockpit.
For the right paddler and use intent it might be fine. Cleverly made but just did not meet our needs. We returned it, no issues with REI at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My wife and I just returned from a month long trip through the Canadian Rockies where we used this boat on several impossibly blue lakes feed from fresh glacier runoff. We chose an inflatable due to weight and space limitations for us and our pop top van camper. At 55lbs or so it was easy for us to carry from camp or parking lot to the lake shore. Setup and take down are very simple and fast. We usually had an audience asking 'where get that?'. It stores easy and in a relatively small space. It's performance was surprisingly good. It is easy to paddle, moves through the water well, tracks well and has good glide. Not as good as a solid kayak, but that is part of the trade off. Struggled in windy, choppy conditions. Go with a longer paddle that is recommended. I got a 220 and my wife a 210. We traded them in on longer paddles. She has my 220 and I have the 240. Much better.","I bought this for my 11 year old son who is a beginner. We have taken this out on the river and he loves it. Is is very stable and he did not come out of it once. The included paddle was light and comfortable for a 3.5 hour river excursion. Great kayak for the price, especially when it comes with a paddle.",,,,"This is a good boat. You can tell right away that the plastic used to make this kayak is of high quality. The chair is really comfortable. However, kayak steering is a bit difficult; it just doesn't want to go straight. It is not a huge difference, but definitely shows up when you paddle for sometime. I'd still buy this boat though. It is one of the cheapest kayak in this quality bracket.",,,"Took me 2 hours to build the first time, after 4 uses am down to 5 minutes. make sure you watch the video on their web site on folding the flap to make the straps and snaps easy to connect. light weight and super fun in the water. Easily fits in the trunk of my Audi. One of best purchases I have made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"We bought this boat mostly for lake use and have not been disapointed. My wife and I both fit comfortable inside and we have even stuck our two girls (age 3 and 1) in with us for a short paddle and the boat handles just fine with us all inside. It is easy to store and inflate/deflate however it is rather difficult to get dry. Also, it seems to tend to track to either the left or the right if you don't have the inflatable tubes positioned just right. Overall this is a great boat for the price and works great if you don't have room for a rigid frame boat.","This kayak is very stable, and can be used by a child. The only problem is that water needs to be entirely calm. It tends to be overly affected by wind and current. If you are not a strong and knowledgeable paddler, you might find yourself in trouble. Side handles and seat could be improved.",,,,"New kayak, just did first trip with 3 days on a lake....So, some minor issues (compared to an Old Town sit-in kayak I had before).
1. no real easy place to lock the kayak with a cable...thru the handle would be an easy cut thru the nylon to steal, so would have to go thru a scupper hole which means a longer cable and with an end that fits thru a scupper hole. 2. the foot pegs and rails are just cheap ...they creak and flex and you cannot adjust easily as the adjustment lever is out in front of your foot...need to be a yoga back flex move to reach them (the OT have foot rail adjustments that can be reached from your seat! and are much better quality and build). 3. The small hatch up front between the feet is almost useless due to its small size, AND it is not sealed so anything in there like a cell phone needs to be in a waterproof bag. 4. the beverage cup holder is way up front by the small hatch and again you need to do a yoga back stretch move to reach it...(the OT kayaks have one on each side of the seat!). 5. The seat is made in china ...and due to the square shape, the back of your upper arms hit the corners of the seat on each paddle stroke,...(the OT has a more curved back rest for this reason!). 6. the small round hatch behind the seat is just crazy...it just goes into the inside of the kayak from back to front and anything put in there will disappear into the inside and slide/rattle around until you can get the kayak on land and pick up and get your stuff to slide front or back....very dumb design and makes the hatch not usable in my opinion.
now for a PLUS or two...my medium size dog loves the back deck, after I removed the bungie.. the red color is fantastic and the weight is light for this length of kayak.
So, in summary, my biggest complaints are the cheap quality of the foot pegs and rails and the seat back shape. both may result in my returning the kayak to REI in the near future.....sigh..",,,"This Kayak is performing well in the golf & Inter coastal off Manasota Key, Fl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I bought this kayak for a Caribbean trip that I just got back from. I was gone for 45 days, I paddled 28 of those days, visited 8 countries or territories and the USVI. I paddled either all the way or partially around 8 islands, some times the Atlantic swells were more than I wanted to tackle, so I did not paddle all the way around some islands. I did not use the spray skirt or the backbone. I found the kayak very handy, I had way less trouble packing it back up (when I removed the floor mattress) than what other reviews indicated. It usually cost about $100 to fly to the next island. I was in big seas and high winds (up to 20 foot seas and 25-30 MPH winds). I live in an RV/toyhauler, and do not have room for a hard kayak or canoe. This product works great for my lifestyle. On a sidenote, I can run my own shuttles carrying the kayak on my BMW motorcycle!",I needed a smaller kayak so I didn't need a roof rack. This 9 footer is perfect. The stability and tracking are dead on. The rod holders are secure and even allowed me to troll. Perception made a great choice with this downsized yak!,,,,"Pescadpr Pro was great. It reason I have it a 4 star rating was a missing part - good leg - when I got it to the lake. Took 2 weeks for Perception to ""drop ship"" the part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"So my wife wanted to get a double kayak because she does not feel comfortable being out in one by herself, so I shopped for several before deciding that this was really the only choice we had for being able to transport it with our motorhome. I ended up getting the backbone and the dura-floor and with these it takes about half an hour to set up now that I've done it a few times. Overall I'm happy with the purchase, the kayak is definitely durable and stable. Going on with our 2 dogs works just fine. My biggest complaint is the bag they give you to store it in. Like most things, it fit nicely new, but is a super pain to get back in the bag even if you are careful to fully deflate the kayak. Why they could not give you an extra 4 inches in the bag just boggles my mind.","Got a set of three of these for the family. The built in feet stops are great as it allows our son to fit as well as myself comfortably. It nice to be able to move your feet around as well to different positions while paddling. The only downside we have found with this kayak is it is heavy compared to some others when you have to carry for a long distance, recommend getting a cart to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"If you have the money to spend, you can not go wrong with this inflatable kayak. It is extremely sturdy and much stronger than many of the other inflatables out on the market right now (and I have tried many). You will feel great comfort knowing that a stick or rock aren't easily going to puncture the sides of this beast.","I bought two of these kayaks two years ago and use them frequently during the summer and early fall. I am delighted with the ease in which you can get on and off this kayak! I highly recommend this model because of the molded back rest. The seat cushion that comes with the boat is too thin for a long paddle. To compensate for this, I simply add a thicker cushion. The paddle that comes with with the kayak is wonderful. No need to go buy a different one, Five stars for this kayak!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Use on rivers, lakes, ocean estuaries. Like convertible feature from double to single. Also like ability to use deck or not. Good stability - handled big blow on Tomales Bay when other kayaks had problems.
Cleaning and repacking the kayak is a major pain - takes longer than set-up (why do recreation companies love to use packing bags that are two sizes too small?). I keep a tarp in my van to throw the kayak in after paddling and deal with cleaning and repacking at home. Depending on the weather, it may take several days for the kayak to dry out.","I picked this kayak up on sale at REI for a great price. It has become my favorite boat for the slow-moving, shallow, sandy-bottom river near my house. No moving parts; just toss it in the back of my compact pickup truck, clip it to the cargo hooks in the truck bed, and I’m off for a good workout and fun!
Pros: durable, made in USA, light-weight, molded in seat and handles fore and aft. Plus, Perception kayaks stack: this one fits perfectly on top of my daughter’s Perception Tribe 9.5-ft Kayak, freeing up storage space in my garage and truck bed.
Cons: Seat angle is a bit off from vertical; I added a Coast Guard approved Type IV throwable flotation device to put between my back and the seat. Perfect! And it never hurts to have an extra flotation device.
Now, my expensive 12-ft sit inside kayak stays on the rec room floor, waiting for the occasional trip to a large lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My wife and I did quite a bit of research before buying this kayak. What's attractive about it is that it's well made, the materials are high quality and can take a lot of load. The only issue is that I'm quite heavy and when I sit in the back, the kayak is so low that some water gets in with waves.
Advanced elements has a more expensive version that's blue, and has a much better bottom cushion and seats and allows for higher inflation pressure.
Pros: Well made, seems durable, very stable on water, 2 main chambers,
Cons: a bit heavy, tracking is just OK, bends somewhat on waves (see accessories), cheap seats that are not comfortable, potentially fragile bottom cushion, hard to tell if it's under or over inflated.
Accessories that are essential: deck conversion kit - this will keep the water from splashing in and your legs dry. Gets a bit harder to get in and out but it's well worth it.
backbone - I bought one to prevent the kayak from bending on waves and potentially improve tracking, the tracking part is hard to tell, because it's not very easy to install the backbone properly.",My daughter and I paddled to a floating campground in a bayou. We were able to pack all of the camping gear onto the kayak with no balance issues. We paddled through shallow canals and did not get stuck in the mud. On the way back the tide was working against us. The rear handle made it easy to attach a tow strap to to help my daughter fight the current. I highly recommend this kayak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I am a 64-year-old grandmother. I bought the Advanced Elements Inflatable Tandem Kayak yesterday to have something to poke around in the lakes and bayous of East Texas and then to take aboard our sailboat when we are able to resume full-time cruising. I tried it out today and I really like it. I’d like to address a couple of issues mentioned in other reviews.
1. Folks mentioned that the spring valves didn’t work correctly and they had to set them in the deflate mode to fill. The instructions (I’m an old lady, I read instructions) say that the spring might be too stiff if you’re using a 12-volt pump and you will need to put the valve in the deflate position to get those to work. Since you have to top the 2 main chambers off with a hand or foot pump anyway, and since it took only about 50 strokes (up and down) to fill each chamber with the hand pump, I can see no reason to use a 12-volt pump anyway. I had no trouble with the valves using the hand pump.
2. Others reported that it was next to impossible to get the boat back into the carry bag. Again, according to the instructions (those darn instructions) you should use a reversible pump to pump the air back out of the boat to get it really flat. I bought the hand pump from Advanced Elements and used it in the deflate mode to draw down the boat as flat as I could. I folded it according to the instructions and got it back into the bag unassisted.
I only took a short paddle around the marina, but even with the “assistance” of my 5-year-old grandson, had no trouble moving the boat. It was very comfortable and seems well made. I got some water on it paddling, and more spraying it off because I took it in salt water. Using a towel to wipe it out as another reviewer suggested worked well, and it dried pretty quickly.
I would like to suggest two things. The rings around the spring valves that hold them in place in the fabric were loose. One was so loose that it came off when I pushed the valve in to set it. I was able to get it back in and tightened, but that’s something that should be checked before shipping. If you get on of these, check those rings before you try to inflate the boat. Also, unless there is a deliberate effort to not have someone fold the boat in exactly the same place each time when packing it, it would be really nice to have lines on the bottom of the hull where the folds should be made. I thought I got it close, but the folded boat was shorter than the bag and maybe a bit shorter than the original folds, so I’m not certain.
However, I’m really happy with the boat so far and glad that I bought it.","After researching seemingly every available sit on top kayak, we decided on this and are so glad we did. I read many reviews on cheaper made Chinese kayaks that don't hold up or don't handle well.
We spent about $70 more to buy American and man was it worth every penny and then some.
We found this at REI and let me tell you why we love it so much: *Smartly designed integrated handles in bow and stern instead of fabric handles that will break eventually *Reinforced drag area in back (people will drag kayaks by the bow instead of carrying them and this wears thru the cheap plastic in no time, rendering kayak useless). *integrated back and seat instead of cheap seat with straps
This kayak design is simply awesome, I don't usually take the time to write reviews but had to for this one.
We use it on Lake Michigan and it handled 3-4 foot waves day one on the water, they describe it as a flat water kayak, but I'm here to tell you this thing can handle Lake Michigan surf, and handle it well.
It's design almost reminds me of a Native American or Inuit designed wood kayak from the days of old, very stable on the water taking 3-4' waves staright on or broadside didn't matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"We've had this kayak for about a month and have taken it out on the ocean, lake, and a slow moving river- it's ideal on all three. My wife and I are not super experienced paddlers, but we were still able to keep up with tandem hard shell boats (we're about 280lbs combined weight), this kayak is sturdy and tracks well for an inflatable. The aluminum inserts in the stern and bow make a big difference in maneuverability and control and although we haven't tried it I'm not sure the optional backbone is really necessary. Yes, it is heavy, but in my opinion the extra weight is worth the peace of mind knowing you're in a sturdy well-built boat, (and it still folds up so you aren't lugging around a cumbersome hard shell on top of your car). Of course it isn't designed for serious whitewater, you wouldn't be shopping for this boat if it was- but the advantage of it not being self-bailing is that you get better performance on flat water and fairly mellow rivers. Just follow the directions, it sets up very simply, but you do need to get the proper inflation pressure, you can't get there with a simple air mattress pump. All in all, no complaints, this was a good buy for us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"We have only tried this a couple of times so far and it has worked pretty well. We were looking for the relatively lighter weight and convenience of an inflatable tandem kayak but wanted it to track as well as our tandem sit in (similar to Perception Cove). This is fitting the bill for our needs--much lighter compared to a plastic boat, tracked fairly well even in windy conditions. There is a metal stay in the front and back plus a small plastic skeg that help with performance. It only took about 5 minutes to inflate with the manual pump once we read the directions. We love the Velcro paddle straps for when we're not using them and there is plenty of space for 2 adults. The boat is wider than a standard plastic kayak so you get slightly more drip off the paddle (need to paddle at a slightly higher angle compared to normal) but it wasn't bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Kayak was easy to inflate, very comfortable too. We kayaked for 9 hours on Lake Superior along the Pictured Rocks coastline. It was a calm day so can't say how it would perform in rough water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I bought this a little more than a year ago, and have put it on the water on the surf and bay side of South Padre Island, TX; have kayaked up and down the river (yes it can go against the current) in the Santa Elena Canyon on the Rio Grande in Big Bend State Park, Texas; and have taken it down the ""Racetrack"" class III rapids on the Rio Grande near Taos, New Mexico; each time with two people on board. Most of the time, I hauled it to a nearby airport in the back of my Cessna 210 aircraft and tossed it in the back of a rental car at my destination. The best thing about it is portability. I expected it to take a long time to pump up, but with a hand pump that pumps on both up and down strokes, it is pumped up in no time at all. The worst thing about it is that very small waves will wash into the kayak. I am planning to buy a skirt for it before taking it on the ocean surf or down Class III rapids again, because I was continually pulling it over and dumping the water out of it. It won't sink, it just becomes like a pulling lead anchor when it fills up with water. Coming down the Class III rapids, once we were caught sideways in the main current between two huge boulders, and the current tried to turn the boat into a ""U"" shape before we could wedge free. There did not seem to be any damage. We have also dragged it over many rocks and the small keel and the hull fabric seems to be intact. Read the directions regarding how many PSI to pump into the floor (which does not have the fabric strenghth of the ""frame""). My wife keeps asking me to put more air into the floor, because you are often sitting in a puddle and can feel the rocks under your tail, but you have to resist the urge. It is not as fast and maneuverable as a fiberglass kayak, but it is faster than a canoe. I am slightly frustated by how easily it takes on water in waves, but once I buy the skirt I am hoping it will turn into the perfect boat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I just want to write a short comment that echos the others. It really is a great stable inflatable kayak, especially if you live in an apartment. We actually bought this when we lived in a studio in DC! But it is totally worth it - the joy of being on the water. My only complaint that at 60 pounds, it's a bit too heavy for me (a female) to carry down 3 flights of stairs. But I love it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This is an AWESOME kayak! Bought it, took it out on the Colorado River (no rapids) and had a great afternoon giving it a test drive. I would advise buying the backbone and either of the two spray-skirts for this model. The problem I had with it was it ""spread"" out a little because it's not held together with the zipper-on spray skirt. That skirt serves a purpose by not only giving you a cockpit, but by pulling the sides in and giving the kayak a better form. Without the detachable skirt...you will hear the velcro pulling as you paddle. That's because it's not tight and solid. If you do not buy the appropriate backbone, expect some major tracking issues. Currently, REI does NOT offer the backbone for this 15ft kayak. You must buy it from the manufacturer. Bummer. So in a nutshell, it has all the qualities that the Advanced Elements kayaks own. However, in order to make this kayak complete, you have to buy a few necessities to make it complete. I wouldn't even call them upgrades... It should at least come with the spray skirt of your choice at the very least. I do own the Expedition (yellow 13.5ft) with the backbone. It's wonderful. Happy kayaking!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've taken this Kayak out four times since its purchase and wow am I impressed. I've purchased the zip on top double spray deck with it which makes it a bit sturdier and keeps a bit more water from the paddles and waves out but it's not really needed if you don't want to get it. It comfortably carries two people and a 45 pound dog that loves to sit on the bow or walk around the top. The material seems tough and is easy to grip with lots of room on the deck if you have a dog or cargo. I'm 6'5"" with long legs and my partner is 5'11"" also with long legs and we both amazingly fit pretty good. I've pretty much never used the inflatable foot brace that has come with it because sitting in the rear my legs just touch the seat in front.
Pros: Tracks very well Durable material Lots of room for cargo or pets Easy to store and set up Great for two tall people, you can really dial in your seat. Almost impossible to capsize Great for limited storage space Fast with two people
Cons: Pain to dry before storing Need to purchase accessories to really have it be a touring kayak (i.e. top spray deck, drop stitch floor or backbone) Wish it had a way to mount a rudder (will probably try and fabricate one) If water gets in your really sitting in it unless you pump it out. Seems like it's going to be a pain to fit spray skirts over the inflatable reefs for each cockpit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This is the best inflatable kayak out there for your money. It can handle a little bit of waves, but it works best in calm water. The backbone accessory sold separately improves its performance significantly so I would recommend that as well. It is wider than a hardshell kayak so it is stable but for long long trips, it might tire a paddler with smaller frame. I have not used this as a solo kayak because I have a hard time lugging 50 lbs plus accessory to the beach. The setup, however, goes a lot faster with two people. After each use, I take the kayak apart in the front yard and give everything a good rinse through. It takes me about 45 minutes. You don't have to be that thorough but since I paddle in salt water, I want to keep salt from corroding it. Check out the manufacturer website. It has a great forum and you can get more info on maintenance. The bottom line is that an inflatable kayak won't perform as well as a hard shell but I think if you are going compare this to other inflatables, this is as good as it gets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"We've used this kayak a few times now and are finally off and running. We had a few bumps in the road...1st time it buckled on the sides quite often and didn't feel stable, allowing water to leak in so the 2nd time we used more air until very firm/hard to the touch and that worked great but still had some buckling due to passenger weight (we are not over the weight limit, two ""normal""-sized adults). We purchased the 2-person deck converter and that did the trick! The kayak just needed something to hold it all together. Wish it was included with the purchase of the kayak, it's pretty basic. Now we LOVE the thing...so much fun. Drying out takes some time and wish it had a drain plug but its worth the trade off of transporting and storing a hard-shell. A bit heavy but we carry it on our shoulders to launch and it's fine. Also wish the case had wheels (add on accessory, purchase separately) and wish the kayak came with a backbone (another expensive accessory) Even if AE annoyingly piece meals everything, we have no regrets. Can't wait for our next trip to the lake!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My Wife and I are complete beginners to the ""sport"" of kayaking, so we researched a lot of kayaks before settling on this beauty. We wanted something reasonably priced, as well as comfortable. (Most tandem kayaks retail for over one thousand dollars, and this was far too much to invest in our first kayak.) It needed to be small enough to transport without the hassle of purchasing and installing a roof rack, yet also large enough to carry the two of us and our two children. We have a four year old and a two year old - both girls who love the outdoors - and we have a strong desire to share the joys of the water as a family. After deciding that an inflatable kayak was the way to go, this Advanced Elements kayak seemed to be the right choice. I actually went to buy this kayak from an REI store near where I work,[...] and that had me worried that we might have made a bad decision. But all of the reviews we had read - both here and on other sites - had my Wife and I convinced that this kayak would be the right one for us. So buy it I did, and let me tell you, I am glad I chose to ignore the sales associate! (She was probably trying to ""up sell"" me to a more expensive hard shell kayak anyway!)We took the kayak to nearby Lake Redman yesterday, and I can state without hesitation that if your goals are like ours, this is the best kayak one can buy! Not one word the sales associate said had any validity as far as I am concerned. The kayak took less than ten minutes to inflate and set up, and that was using a dual action hand pump rather than an air compressor, which is not recommended. The kayak accommodated all four of us comfortably - me and my oldest in the back seat and my Wife and our youngest up front. Paddling and maneuverability are a breeze, and stability is not an issue. The ONLY drawback I was able to detect was that the kayak could use a bit more storage room. There are no cup holders, pockets or pouches except for a small mesh ""bag"" attached to the back of each seat. There is an area in the front which can be used for storage, but one must remember that with two adults and two children already inside, getting to this space is a bit of a chore. Also of note: Unless you intend to buy a deck skirt for this kayak, plan to get a little wet when paddling. Some of the water drips on your legs and lap when working hard, but one does not have to work hard to get this craft moving. I also recommend purchasing a dry box or bag to store important items like cameras, cell phones and ID cards, as well as a dual action hand pump to inflate the kayak. This last item will prove invaluable. We worked this little baby for almost three hours yesterday - stopping only once to eat lunch on the shore - and we barely broke a sweat. The kids loved every minute and never once felt unsafe. Deflation and break down took only two minutes. Simply open the valves and the air comes rushing out. I just folded it back up, threw it in the back of the Xterra, and rinsed it off when we got home. Lay it out to dry in the sun and pack it away until the next trip. Maybe today!Bottom line: If you are thinking seriously about buying this kayak, don't let anyone tell you not to. Not even the sales associate. Trust the reviews and make the purchase. You won't regret it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've only had it out once so far so I can't comment on durability, but in every other regard this is a great boat! A little heavy for one person, but lighter than most 15-ft hardshells and easy to maneuver with two. Easy and fast to inflate...probably under 8 minutes first go. We paddled with two people, and the boat gave surprisingly good performance for tracking and speed, even without the optional rigid bar. Very stable as well at 32"" wide. We were on flat to choppy/windy waters on the Puget Sound. Some inevitable splashing into the boat with the open deck, so can't wait to try it with the single-person convertible deck.
Easy to deflate and stow back in the bag as well, although as others have commented it is difficult to get dry without completely disassembling the tubes from the outer nylon shell. That one small complaint aside, I can't wait to keep this stowed in the back of my car (about the size of a small climbing crash pad when packed) this summer and get out on the water that much more often for it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"We use this product to trout fish and as a dinghy for our boat that is moored on salt water. It inflates quickly, moves through the water as easily as a hard shell, and is very stable. When dry, storing it is a breeze in the included case. I love that you can toss it and your paddles and pump in your trunk and go. You can even check it on a plane. Amazing boat - highly recommend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"After owning a Necky Manitou tandem for two years we decided to look for a Yak we could pack into the RV as mounting a rigid Yak on an RV is a BIG pain unless you tow something to mount it on. After reading the reviews it looked like the AE Convertible was a contender. [...] We bought the boat with the back bone option.No doubt that this Yak and it's siblings are the best of the inflatables. Our reaction to the experience is based on an apples and oranges comparison to a rigid Yak but that considered there are several things that would greatly improve this good product and make it better.Build of the boat and the componentsMy first impression was very positive. The decking is rock solid double stitched, thick walls, good looking and performing valves (although confusing) and a bright color for visibility on the water.-Now the reality--First set up was in the back yard and was relatively easy but found that installing the optional back bone conflicted with the inflatable floor, we had to curl up the ends to make the floor fit.-The main valves are confusing as they have an inflate and deflate setting and have to be set in the deflate position to inflate or air will not pass into the chamber(what???).-The carry bag is JUST big enough but only zippered 1/2 way down the sides so re-inserting the Yak is not easy. It would be a lot better if the zips went to the bottom of the bag allowing it to open like a suitcase.-Once it was all put together it looked and, in our opinion, it's missing a main and very important component, a top deck! These are listed as options but paddling the Yak w/out a deck is not advised for 3 big reasons: 1) you get very wet (least important) 2) the boat spreads open wider than is comfortable as you have to paddle around the sides and 3) the zipper for attaching the deck sits in the outer edge where your arm passes on each stroke with teeth standing up like saw teeth. Both my wife and I hit them several times while paddling, OK so buy one of the decks when you buy the boat but why not simply supply one AE? Or at least something to fill the open zipper teeth with a material bridge in the center of the cockpit to hold the sides of the boat together. [...]-I did buy the optional back bone, another option that should be standard for an IK unless you like the folding feel of an inflatable and even poorer tracking. After an hour of sitting on the padded 1"" rod it got very uncomfortable, (like sleeping on a fold out sofa). By simply adding some padding to the seat you'd never feel a thing and you'd have the badly needed rigidity the back bone gives.-The seats, well if they were any thinner - - -. AE will sell you a ""quality"" air seat that probably is nice.-The inflatable floor, it's low end air mattress quality. AE will sell you an optional ""quality"" drop stitch floor for another up-charge (am I feelin nickel and dimed here? Not at what they charge for these ""options"")The rideOK, it is an inflatable but I have to wonder;-Tracking is almost there, better than I expected. There are chines and a skag welded to the hull but the chines are only 14"" long. The yaks got to fold to get into the bag but making the chines full length of the boat may be the answer to the poor tracking and the weathercocking.SummaryOur first (and maybe our last) outing was just OK. we did not expect it to have the tracking and glide our Necky has but due to the factors mentioned I consider this boat an unfinished product. You can, at your expense, make it a lot better buy adding the things AE should build into the boat in the first place and some things AE needs to consider improving in the design would make this yak a much better boat.I would recommend this boat to a friend with BIG qualifications and add that you almost have to add several expensive options to make it work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Got all the way out to the river to take it for a spin with a foot pump to inflate only to find out that the instructions literally say that you need their ""new special attachment"", what a bummer. Had to go back to rei and spend even more money to get the advanced elements inflation accessories",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"We are very pleased with this boat and it delivered on everything we expected. We did borderline obsessive research before finally settling on this kayak. We have a Advanced Elements Lagoon 1 which is their lower end rec kayak and were happy with its construction and ease of use, so we finally settled on this one. We liked the versatility of it and it's ability to do just about anything that we want to. Plus the large amount of accessories and a large community helps too. We purchased this kayak and promptly took it out to Chincoteague island on the eastern shore for some testing. We used in in sheltered waters in an inter-coastal waterway and in narrow channels in marshes and were impressed with it's performance. It tracks strait even without the backbone which we couldn't get in time for this trip but have since purchased. We had it set up as a single person and had some gear in it as well. It was still easy enough for a 140lb woman to paddle in both light wind and winding channels without any trouble. Set up and take down was easy and the instructions are nice, they actually have a diagram of how to fold it up as well. The dual action pump makes deflation easy and is a worthy accessory. About performance. It performs like you would expect it too, it is an inflatable kayak and won't beat a sea kayak in a race or have perfect tracking but for an inflatable kayak does a really good job. It is a wonderfully stable boat and does not feel like it will ever flip and even it does it's inflatable so it will float upside down. It is a little heavy to carry around, but so are most 15' boats. And the fact that we didn't have to get a roof rack is awesome! Bottom line, this is a great boat for anyone who doesn't want a roof rack or does a lot of traveling and want's a good sturdy, do anything kayak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This is my first kayak - I had been wanting to get one for a while, but was struggling with how I was going to transport it. Also, I have two kids - 6 and 8 - and I wanted a way to share this with them.
I ran across this hybrid/inflatable kayak on the REI site and the reviews really peaked my interest. It sounded like a perfect way for me to get into the sport, and based on my first outing this weekend, I am thrilled with the purchase.
We did a dry run of inflating it in the garage (I didn't want to be at a lake trying to figure it out!). I bought the backbone (recommend it), and I wanted to see how to get that properly aligned. It all was pretty simple, and first time through took us about 20 minutes. Using the Double Action hand pump, I followed the advice of about 50 pumps into each of the main chambers and 15 into the floor (and one pump each into the decking). Deflating was a breeze. Loaded it into the minivan and we were off.
At the lake, it took about 10 minutes to get it ready. I didn't find I had to be so precise with the floor - perhaps because I have the backbone. We did inflate most of the boat without the floor in so we could adjust the backbone slightly. Then floor fit in and pumped it up, and we were set!
If I had been on my own I would have wanted to do this right by the water's edge as it is hard to move around by yourself.
Once on the water, I really found the kayak to be very stable, comfortable and easy to maneuver. Seats were fine. I had my 6-year old out first - she was in the front, I was in the back. I didn't like the footrest - I am 5' 9"" and my legs were a bit cramped - may try next time without it. Next I took my 8-year old and her friend - put them in the back and I paddled in the front. That worked just fine - plenty of legroom. I have not yet tried it solo, but likely will do so later this weekend.
Clean up was a lot easier than I expected. Quick deflate, wiped it with a towel, folded it up and tossed into back of the van. At home, we laid it out to dry for a bit and stuck some bike helmets in the stern and bow areas to allow some air flow under there. I think using a box fan could be good too, but weather was such that it dried out fine as is. Folded it up and we are ready for another trek to a lake today.
Overall, this is just what I was looking for as a way to start enjoying the lakes and have a way to take the kids out too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"So far I'm not impressed and have not gotten it on the water as I hoped. Got it Thursday and hoped to use it this weekend.
The main valves have very unclear instructions. Had to go to the Advanced Elements site and scroll through their discussion forums to PIECE together information.
In the ""inflate"" position my electric pump puts nothing in at all.
In the ""deflate"" position my pump will start filling it. I do not, and did not, expect this to ""complete the job"" and make it taunt but no info at all that an electric pump would necessitate having the valve in the deflate position to put any air at all in.
And when I take it off the air is coming out pretty fast before the valve can be put into the ""inflate"" position, which would keep the air in.
Poor valve choice IMO. Have seen better. Have another brand I bought that I can mostly inflate with an electric and then finish off even blowing it in by mouth and not lose air.
ALSO, the valve caps on these main valves are tethered on with a cheap and too short PVC type of material string. One of those broke off already.
I will try doing this with an Advanced Elements hand pump that I have ordered. I assume that its fittings will not be snug according to what I read on their own discussion forum and will add some tape to it.
If this does not work satisfactory on Monday when I get the pump it will all be sent back.
If it works I will update this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Ordered the Advanced Elements AirFrame Convertible. Ordered the drop stitch floor, just cuz, and the spray deck for two. Ordered several other accessories and such. Lots of money invested. Were we nervous? Yes. We ordered all that based on others reviews. A little risky. Were also interested in the Sea Eagle 385 but no reviews whatsoever from consumers. ?. Who needs that? Let me tell you we shopped this to DEATH. This is the best there is considering wt., capacity, width (do you really think you'll be comfortable paddling a 38"" kayak), and price. Although don't be misled. If you get all the goodies not included with the boat (like pump and paddles for starters, $250.00 right there), you'll go by $1000.00 at a dead run.Took it out on a lake. Had a lovely time. Came back nice and dry. Tracks well, doesn't blow around. Nice. Got a compliment on it. So we're one for one.I would like to tell you a few things I wish I knew going in:Airkayak is the outlet for Advanced Element products as far as we know. they're customer service is unbelievable. Here in Central Florida it is next to impossible to find an air gauge for an inflatable kayak. Order it on the pump from Advanced Elements.During inflation make sure you are reading the gauge right. The black lines are usually Bars and it is the pink inner lines which are PSI. There are two tubes they call the main chambers that go all the way around the kayak. These are the biggest to pump up and are no problem at all. About Thirty five pumps in each with a double action hand pump. You have to be careful because the two tubes share the same pocket and have to be pumped up equally. The valves are a breeze. Don't worry about that. No need for a car 12V pump. After the main chambers you have the floor which is much easier and then all the little stuff to pump up which is just a few pumps each. The whole process is very quick.The spray decks zip on from the rear.We received no manual with our boat, the drop stitch floor needs a separate adapter and no literature or repair kit came with it. So we had to print a manual online at AE and find out the PSI of the floor which is 7.It is a little heavy, but like someone else said in a review, that's a good thing. You don't want a light weight. We bought a Coleman Canoe/Kayak transporter to take it down to the lake or river. Works great. Hard shells are heavier by the way.Carlisle Rodeo paddles from Dick's Sporting Goods work great. 230cm. Fiberglass, light, larger paddle on the end. Two piece though.Ordered the second foot rest for the front seat. My wife says it's great. Like that little anchor AE sells. If you see a turtle swimming or something you want to watch, just drop anchor and pull yourself back to observe.After you take it out of the water, just prop it up a little, wipe down the outside with a towel, remove the spray deck and seats, deflate (use your pump to aid in deflation), fold and stow. When folding make sure you keep the straight line straight. Folds real nice that way.That's all I got for now. Remember, with gas prices on the rise, and renting a kayak at $20.00 a pop at least (and you have to be back at a certain time which ruins the whole experience), your saving a lot of money. The best things in life are",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"So, my first kayak was a tandem hardshell... one crack on the bottom and we capsized... in calm waters (class 1-2)... SO this guy is awesome!!! Before the hardshell died, if I wanted tk take it out, I always had to find a second to join me. It wasn’t the most feather-weight boat but, it was in the middle and Atill hard to lift (I am 5’9”, 165 lbs and strong).
I love this inflatable... for it’s durability AND it’s comfort... it’s ease of use and it’s flexibility (switches from tandem to single with a few rips of the velcro!)
One word of advice, skip the crummy ‘car-compatible’ cig-lighter powered pump... for a few bucks more you can get an overly-adequate 110 ac pump, invest in a power station (Portable generator or Jackery solar powered power station)... finish it with a hand pump, if needed and you are golden with this set up with 15 minutes of landing at your destination. Perfect for early sunrise floats, summer full moon retreats and spontaneous ditch day adventures!
Enjoy life!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Unfortunately could not find a location that already had it in stock, much less set up.

Your best bet are the aquaglides",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The setup time is minimal and the craft is unexpectedly comfortable.
The kayak is heavy to carry long distances but to maintain the crafts benefits probably cannot be lighter.

,,,,"We replaced our Sevarin inflatable kayak that we got at the thrift store with this advanced element model. We take it on monthlong van camping trips and use it on lakes locally. We have only used it on lakes.
The kayak is much more comfortable than our old one. Handles well. Overall we are happy we bought it.
Here are the problems: 1. It’s difficult to dry. You have to take it completely apart and let it sit out the sun for hours to dry it. This works in So Cal, more problematic when we are traveling in the northwest. It’s a lot more work dealing with this kayak than the Sevaran
2. The bag it comes in is too small and should have the zippers extending all the way around. It helps to take the kayak apart completely and store it in the bag.
3. You have to buy their special pump. Plan on another $40 and extra storage area when you travel. They have proprietary valves that don’t work well with our electric pump with many attachments. We use the electric pump thatn top it off with their pump as REI recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,Only used the Advanced Elements Kayak once and we love it. Easy to inflate and glides through the water well. Very comfortable to sit in and quiet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,I like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It's a great value because it’s versatile. For the money, you get a 1 or 2 man kayak. Not bad for a recreational kayaker.It’s also versatile as to where you can store it. Since it's inflatable, it's great for apartment dwellers like me. I don't have much room so compressing the kayak into a bag is great. I also like the fact that it does not look like a cheap inflatable toy boat in the poolside.It’s pretty stable.Since it’s inflatable, it is also not rigid. I rode through where there are wakes created by motorboats. The kayak would absorb the forces of the waves without the fear of tipping over.The rigid aluminum frame for the stern and the bow really does work cutting through the water. I would not say that it would glide through the water as well as a rigid kayak but for what it is, it’s not bad.IT’S QUICK TO SET-UPI don’t have to mount the kayak on top of the car to take it from my home to the water. I just throw it into the trunk and go. Since it’s in the car, I’m not concerned about the security of the kayak and it does not create more drag for the car.Pumping air into the kayak does not take long either. I think I clocked myself 20 minutes to get it all set up. I recommend getting a cheap motorized air compressor [$] for the initial part of inflating the kayak, then use the double action pump (from REI) to get the pressure that’s need for the kayak. You can save your energy for paddling.HERE’S THE BAD THING ABOUT ITThe top part of the boat is made of heavy-duty fabric, making it hard to dry. So, although it stores well, you’ll need to have room to let it air dry to make sure it’s clean and dry to prevent it from getting moldy. I see myself having a ½ day of fun then a ½ day of maintenance and repacking the kayak. Honestly, it actually discourage me to go kayak at times.OVERALL, I RECOMMEND IT, but it will depend on your needs. If you see yourself not having a lot of storage space, not serious enough to need a rigid kayak, and you don’t want to spend [$], this is the kayak for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Returned it after one week, testing it twice. It feels like it never fully gets inflated—this may just be the nature of inflatable kayaks. The valves are counterintuitive too: it took me about an hour to figure out that they must be set in the ""deflate"" position in order to inflate. With two people (6'2 160lbs, and 5'10 190), seemed like about max capacity. It sagged in the middle, took on a bunch of water. It's very difficult to haul after you've been in it, because of how floppy it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I own three AE kayaks, all different models. For a simple class 2 river like the Yak, any of these kayaks work great, from beginner to advanced. I live 50 feet from the river and have done everything from rescuing drunk CUW summer floaters to catching cutbows to bird watching along the banks of the canyon. These kayaks are perfect for THIS river. Buy one or two is my recommendation, before they change models. ONLY downside that I see is that they should be limited to 180lbs or less on the solo units.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Took this Advanced element for a two day trip from forest creek Upper Maurice river (NJ) to East Point lighthouse on the DE bay. A beautiful run with the only fast moving river current in NJ and bald eagles towards the bay. I highly recommend it for experienced kayakers. However the AE advanced frame is not a Kayak in any sense of the term 1. Tracking: Zero tracking, it's paddle right resulting in a 30 deg angle followed by left 30 deg angle with each stroke. You don't cut throught the water you waddle, I waddled for almost 40 miles
2. Glide to paddle ratio: Forget it Zero glide. stop paddling and you'll stop 1/2 a second later because there's no tracking but lot's of...
3. Drag: Forget the name there is NO frame except in the bow and stern there is no support under your posterior. Which winds up about 6"" to 9"" lower that the bow and stern. You'll very literally drag your butt across the water. The AE claims to have a 235 lb. limit but at 6ft and 185 I was dead in the water
Then there's the really annoying stuff 4. No accessibility: You don't get into this thing, rather you put it on There's no rigid surface so you ease in and then zip it up. In and out is a struggle and your legs are now encased in inflated rubber you can't move them for the duration which is good because
5. You're only 4"" above the water line: in a very soft sided vessel. Move to either side and you'll take on water, try to adjust your sitting position and take on a lot of water which you can't drain because
6. There's no drain hole or plug: So have fun an splash around like you're in a tub because after all considering how it handles you basically are.
This is the 1st thing I have returned to REI in over 10 years. Their product quality has always been excellent but now I will take their product recommendations and advice with a lot of 3rd party research.
If you want a Kayak and can transport one easily buy a rigid frame I'm still looking for an inflatable that comes half way to being a real kayak. If you know of one please let me know, it would be greatly appreciated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"After weeks of research I ordered one of these because I wanted: 1) A kayak which could easily be switched from tandem to single 2) Could be open topped or fitted with one or two person decks
This really is the only game in town that meets both parameters. I did order my kayak with the optional drop stitch floor. In a nutshell, the drop stitch floor is lighter and many times stiffer than the conventional tubular floor that comes stock with the kayak. It's MUCH better than the stock floor/backbone combo and also easier to install.
Assembly is pretty easy, assuming you first read the manual. I found it easier to pump up than my inflatable SUP. Total assembly including the zip in optional deck is around 15-20 minutes if moving at a casual pace. I would very strongly suggest getting a double action pump which will speed things up considerably.
Packing is a little trickier. When you first receive the kayak and remove it from the bag I would suggest taking a Sharpie marker and making a small mark at each of the fold lines. This will make it easier to remember how to fold it. Precise folding is one of the keys to getting this thing back in the bag. The other tip is to use the double action pump to deflate the kayak. Simply pressing the air out won't work and you'll struggle to get the kayak back in the bag.
On the water it's very stable. I could even stand up and paddle it like a SUP. With the decks on the rear cockpit was a bit cozy. but I had enough foot room and the thwart provided for a good foot brace. In solo mode I wound up stuffing a small dry bag with the thwart in front to provide a foot rest. I was tempted to by the optional foot pegs but am now glad I didn't. Obviously it's not as efficient as a rigid kayak but with the drop stitch floor installed it gets pretty close.
The only real downside is that REI sells it as just the kayak. Would be better if they sold it packaged with the drop stitch floor, double action pump and decks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I coveted this boat for years and finally bought it this year. I'm out in it as often as possible. First the drawbacks that keep it from earning a full five stars:
(1) In single seater mode, the seat can be rather aggravating. I don't know if it's just me or if I am doing something wrong, but I find my body tending to work its way to a reclined position while paddling solo. The thwart (the part that goes right behind the front seat in the photos) provides good back support when paddling with two and prevents that from happening. Unfortunately, there seems to be no good spot to put it while paddling solo.
(2) The darn thing is heavy. It weighs roughly 50 pounds and I really need a cart or some help to carry it any meaningful distance. Gentlemen, I've seen men pick up my yak as if it weighed nothing, so maybe this issue won't apply to you all.
Now the good points. First of all, it's a minority of boats that can operate reasonably well with one or two people. This one does, so you don't really have to choose whether to always paddling together or always paddle with someone. With that said, it really does shine best with two people.
The boat tracks very well, especially for an inflatable. The flip side of that is that it doesn't turn well. That's not a drawback to this kayak. It's just the nature of kayaks. A longer boat will always do better at holding its course in a straight line and a shorter one will always turn better but not do so well at holding a straight course. That's also a big part of why touring/sea kayaks like this one tend to be long and straight whereas whitewater kayaks tend to be short and stubby.
It's that turning ability more than anything where this boat improves by having two people aboard. The force of two paddles is simply more effective at turning than the force of one.
The other pro about the boat is that it can carry a lot of stuff. Maximum capacity is 550 pounds of people + gear. When paddling alone, there is a ton of room to store stuff. When paddling tandem, the weight allowance may be ample but space can be limited.
As you may guess from my talk about maneuverability, whitewater is not where this boat excels. This is a boat for tidal waters, flat water, and gentle rivers. I often use it on the tidal portions of the Potomac, but it will suit well for lakes, coastal waters, etc.
I haven't had it for a huge long period of time, but it has certainly scraped by some rocks and such on the bottom, including while passing through Class I white water. So far the only result of that is muddy streaks on the bottom. I've had no signs of damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My wife & I have had this boat for about 4 years, and we've paddled it in lakes, rivers, bayous, swamps, and the ocean. It's been everywhere from the Florida Keys and Cape Kennedy for a space shuttle launch to the Rio Grande River in Big Bend National Park, to Mono Lake and several other mountain lakes in the high sierras of California.
This is the best inflatable kayak/canoe we've ever come across... hands down.
Drying time is quick when the craft is broken down into its basic components.
The craft is ridgid when properly set up and fully inflated. We do have the ""backbone"" accessory, but we've never used it, nor have we ever needed to use it.
The craft is so stable that we regularly pause for a quick swim, then easily climb back in and continue paddling... GREAT relief on a hot day.
As for storage space on the kayak, we purchased two deck bags from REI and they provide LOTS of space for jackets, an anchor & line, throw bag, first aid kit, emergency air pump, bilge pump, patch kit, water, binoculars, lunch, etc. Without the deck bags, we were pretty cramped if we wanted to bring all that stuff. Now, it's like having modular storage... pack it at home, then clip it into place and go. When the trip's over, unclip, and unpack at home.
Yes, I have recommemded this craft to several friends, and I'll buy another when (if) this one wears out from all the use it gets.
Overall, this is a GREAT BOAT!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I’ll write my review in two parts: first impression and after a year.
My REI dividend arrived and during the next membership sale I placed my order for this boat. I had researched this quite a bit and read a lot of reviews, and settled on this boat because of its versatility and stowability. I like that I can use it and handle it alone or bring my wife, my son or a friend and have an open cockpit or enclosed cockpit(s) with skirts. It fits in a bag and that fits in the back of a Prius. It fits inside my minivan and rests dry and secure with the rest of my camping gear, dogs and family. I can set it up in my driveway, secure it in the bed of my old pickup and use it like a hard shell driving short distances in the open bed to a drop in point. I can lash it to the deck of my sailboat to use as a portable dinghy or to just putz around an anchorage, then deflate it and stow it below.
After receiving it, I set it up in my living room using a 12V Coleman pump and an AE dual action pump with pressure gauge. I installed the after market drop stitch floor (reviews indicated this is a huge plus and so far I agree) and set up both solo and tandem configurations with the after market decks. Everything went well indoors. I did the same in my driveway a few weeks later, tossed it in the truck, and headed to some local ponds. Easy to unload and launch. I managed to clamber in from the side and remain dryfoot for my paddle in solo configuration with just the deck and not the skirt. I immediately noted how stable it is and rigid with the drop stitch floor. I’m no stranger to narrow boats as an experienced paddler, rower and sculler. There was no wobbliness as I dropped down into my seat (the after market seat with stiffeners). I shoved off and started paddling. Very stiff and rigid. I like that my backside was totally supported on the floor and didn’t feel like it was hanging in the water dragging bottom. It tracked well for a flat bottom, high windage boat on a windy day with one 200lb+ paddler. Did I get a little nervous around beaver lodges with sharp sticks poking out from the bottom? Of course, but I had no trouble.
For what I’m after: a versatile boat that stows small, I’m already liking it. Is the Tsunami hardshell with contoured cockpit, ultra adjustable seat and retractable rudder (my other choice) more performance and endurance oriented? You betcha. But I’m going to put a rudder on this and putz around on ponds, lakes, streams, rivers, bays and maybe the ocean and have a perfectly good time. Should I take up serious touring, I’ll consider something different then. But, I’m very happy following my maiden voyage today and plan to update this review in a year or so.
Think about what you are buying and why, and if this fits, don’t be put off by reports that’s it’s not a high performance boat (it’s not), but a good inflatable that handles many tasks well enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My wife and I have been paddling canoes together for more than 25 years. I've paddled canoes regularly for 55. We traded our 84# Sawyer Voyager for a 42# We-no-nah Spirit II a couple of years ago when we could no longer life the heavy boat onto the top of our Toyota minivan. I can now load the Spirit II by myself! We never thought we'd go kayaking as everyone we saw doing it seemed to have a hard time getting in and out and all the honest ones complained about how sore their backs and butts got from the small backrests and hard seats.
I was at an REI store one day when the Advanced Elements rep was there. He inflated the 10 ft. model in about 5 minutes using only a handpump. I was impressed with the materials and the stiffness of the boat. Being totally open it was simple to get in and out. My wife said she wasn't interested so I bot the Expedition (13.5 ft. solo). I took it to a local river and tried it out adn came home smiling. My wife was suspicious that I'd found a mermaid and insisted that I take her back and let her try it. She wouldn't get out. I order the Convertible (15 ft. solo or tandem model) the next day. We may never paddle a canoe again.
This boat is a breeze to set up. It take about 3 minutes to inflate it most of the way with a little electric pump (plug in the cigarette lighter in the car) and another 10 pumps with the Adv. Elements Double Action Hand Pump (also from REI) in each of the two main tubes. NOTE: Be sure to get the pump with the air guage so you won't overinflate the tubes!!! I use the elec. pump to inflate the bottom ""air mattress"". All told, it takes less than ten minutes from unpacking the kayaks until they're inflated and ready to launch.
I love getting to a boat ramp and watching other folks lifting down kayaks from on top of their cars adn then squeezing down into them before launching, often scooching along, scraping the bottom of their kayak to get into the water. I know they're going to have to drive home with all that gear on top of their cars and then store that stuff someplace.
My kayaks fit into the space of a large suitcase in the back of my van where I leave them most of the summer with the paddles and the rest of the gear.
My wife sits in front where she's free to paddle when she wants or, more often than not, she leans back in the seat, puts her legs up on the edges of the kayak and dozes off while we float.
The kayak tracks as well as any comparable-length hard-hulled boat I've paddled (and I've paddled a lot at the REI paddle sports days).
The kayak is so stable that I can stand with one foot on either gunnel and rock back and forth and not tip it over. We sometimes paddle out away from shore and jump out into the water to swim around. It's easy to crawl back in over the gunnel and there's no need for someone to hold onto the other side while you do that to keep from turning over. I can't think of a safer way to start a child kayaking. I doubt a child could tip the kayak over if they tried.
The bottom of the kayak is 3 layers of durable material. Last weekend paddling in the Cascades of OR I accidentally paddled over several very sharp pieces of volcanic rock (Sparks Lake is full of it) and dreaded having to repair the damage back at camp. I couldn't even find where the rock had scraped along! In any case, the main part of the kayak is 2 concentric air bladders so even if one is punctured the other would keep you afloat.
don't buy one of these if you just invested in an expensive canoe as you might end up needing to sell the canoe!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Purchased 1 yr ago. First couple of times out without the tandem skirt we were disappointed with the ""flex"" in kayak. Could be from under inflation, we don't have a pressure gauge & didn't want to over inflate. We then added the skirt which improved the ""flex"" & kept us drier & safer when the motor boats get a little to close. I'm 6'4"" so I'm cramped in the back seat & not able to use the middle inflatable ""pillow"" that comes with this unit. It is also more difficult to enter & exit. My opinion is that most people are going to be much happier with the skirt. I'd also suggest the ""bone"" for carrying & floating stability. I don't have that part but just think it would be helpful. Folded in the case it fits in my Smart car.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This is the second inflatable my girlfriend and I bought, and we love it. We don't have a car to easily transport a hardshell, nor do we have space to store one. Our first attempt at inflatables (a Sea Eagle) failed miserably - it was slow,cramped, offered little support and was overall not a lot of fun. We decided to give the AE a shot and were very impressed - its very stable, tracks well, is comfortable and roomy. I was warned by the REI employee that as an inflatable it would still be a bit sluggish, but have not found that to be the case at all. I've raced my brother in a cheaper hardshell and beaten him easily, and matched with two-person rental kayaks that friends have tried, we've easily outpaced them. It has performed equally well for us on rivers and at sea. I'm sure higher priced kayaks can definitely out-perform it, but for the price it matches well with hardshells. Friends who have tried it out have been very impressed with how smooth and stable the AE is compared to the hardshells they have tried.
The only cons are that it is not light (but its a big boat) and can be a little difficult to dry it off well and stuff it in the bag after a trip. If you want a boat but don't have the space to store a rigid kayak or the ability to transport one, the Advanced Elements kayak is wonderful - especially since this one can function as a 1 or 2 person vessel. Even if you do have the space, it may be worth considering because in my (somewhat limited) experience, it is at least as good as many of the hardshells in its price range, and possibly more comfortable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I bought this boat a few years ago and definitely don't regret it. The primary reason I got it was because it can be set up to paddle tandem or solo, but I also got it because it is so portable. I got it when my wife and I took a trip up to Montana. We wanted to do some paddling, but it was a small part of our trip. Lugging a hardshell from Arizona to Montana and back and around Montana for 2 weeks seemed absurd, not to mentioned we'd have to buy a roof rack, saddles, the whole 9 yards. We fit the boat, associated gear, and two weeks of other travel stuff in our rather small Chevy Prizm. Space was tight, to be sure, but the fact that it all fit in such a small car is amazing. And that's one of the great benefits of this boat. You can even take it on a plane! (though we haven't yet).
This boat is so stable I liken it to the Queen Mary. I can't even imagine rolling this thing under normal conditions. You'd have to get hit broadside by a pretty big wave I think. It makes a great platform for photography too, as it has plenty of flat floor space for gear.
I've found the boat to be pretty quick for what it is. I can pull 3 mph out of the thing solo, and 3.5-4 mph with my wife in front (and she's not a strong paddler). It tracks well . . . in calm conditions at least . . . I've found that wind really turns this boat around, I believe a fairly common issue with inflatables.
I do have a few gripes about the boat, some having to do with the boat itself, some having to do with the nature of an inflatable.
I did a two week trip down in Baja, doing a lot of kayaking. I got tired of inflating and deflating the boat every day, sometimes twice a day, as we moved from place to place. I tried leaving it inflated on the roof of my friends truck/shell, but the vibration from the rough Baja roads started to wear through the fabric. (For this reason and others, I now also own a solo hardshell kayak.) If you're moving a lot, you may get tired of an inflatable.
As for the gripes about the boat itself . . . 1. Since the floor is a separate piece, water and dirt gets underneath it. I have yet to find a good way to clean and dry this boat out after a paddle. I always end up packing it wet and taking it home where I let it sit all gutted out in my garage for a day or so. Even then, water holds on in the nooks and crannies. 2. Another floor problem. Since it is a separate piece, every time you take it out to clean the boat, you then have to try to get it back in to the right place. If the floor is off center either horizontally or longitudinally, the boat is either off-kilter or has a bulge in the hull due to the main tubes pushing the shell fabric down. I ended up measuring out where centered would be, and then marked the outline of the floor (deflated) on the hull piece so that I could get it reasonably aligned every time. 3. The floor again (see a pattern?). You have to be really careful not to over-inflate the floor. While the other tubes need to be inflated until they are quite firm, the floor should still be soft. this means that your glutimous maximus actually creates a low spot in the floor. (I've actually had my butt get stuck on a rock in this boat because it was the lowest part of the hull! Go ahead, laugh.) Some way to stiffen the floor would definitely be helpful.
I also blew the floor out once, though I'm not sure how. The weld between the tubes broke at the same time. I patched the whole in the floor easily and was able to continue my trip. When I sent the floor back to Advanced Elements, they thought that I had overinflated the floor, but since they had never seen the internal weld break like that, they gave me a new floor for free. They also gave me some new buckles for the seats for free so I could do a little customization. Can't complain about their customer service!
I've used this boat mostly on lakes, but have also taken it out on the ocean in Baja. I haven't had it in any serious surf though.
As I said earlier, I now have a solo hardshell (Wilderness Systems Tsunami), but plan on keeping the AE Convertible indefinitely. I use it when my wife goes kayaking with me, and it's great for out of town guests when I want to take them out. It also enables me to throw two hardshell kayaks on my roof rack and the AE in the trunk and have enough boat space for 4 people!
Oh, and I have done a 3 day camping trip out of this boat. It's a real gear hauler! I even hauled a few armloads of firewood in with all the rest of my gear (and I was able to keep pace with a more lightly loaded 12 foot hardshell).
So while it's no longer my boat of choice when I'm paddling solo, and if I were to buy another tandem boat I'd go with something like the Manitou II (which can also be paddled solo), I continue to be happy that I own this boat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Bought with 1 hope in mind - this inflatable was supposed to be more practical due to ease of storage and transportation. I was wrong... the negatives FAR outweigh the positives with this one. The hassle with setting it up and putting away alone killed the deal.
First the positives: - Tracks better then expected. No where near as good as a rigid kayak (don't get fooled, it's not even close) but usable for messing around you local lake. - Looks nice and materials seem to be of decent quality.
Stuff that was obvious after 1st ride: - It's soft. Properly inflated it's just too soft. All around. - Floor is absolute junk. 1psi, paper thin material basically feels like it's not even there. - Because of the junk floor you end up sitting waaay too low (or rather too deep) and there's very little support = you loose lots of energy when paddling and get fatigued quicker due to weird sitting position. - Seats are thin and don't stay in place well, support is minimal. - Unless you get the pricy optional skirt the boat is again, too soft, especially in the middle, too wobbly, and you easily get chafed with the nasty zipper that's in the worst position possible.
In short - to make this boat better you basically have to buy the unreasonably priced optional rigid floor and optional skirt. Check the pricing ;) Suddenly the perceived value evaporates - I really can't stand buying product that essentially forces you into ""upgrades"" to make it work.
Given that we had low expectations for this boat in the first place, we would probably overlook the negatives and keep the boat for when we don't want to haul our real rigid kayak, BUT... it takes good 15-20 min to set it up and inflate and another 20-25+ to deflate and put a way it was a total deal breaker and just such hassle. Imagine dealing with this on regular basis, in hot weather, especially on a shore with sand, gravel, and other debris as you try to deflate and fold it into a much too small bag. No thanks! Oh, and the adapters/pump are proprietary, which of course REI doesn't carry the one AE recommends (one with a gage) so we had to order elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,We've had our tandem kayak for years and love it! We upgraded to the stiffer drop stitch floor and would recommend it. Our kayak is incredibly stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hands down, this is the best boat for it's DESIGNED application.....Just ask my wife Ali, I research everything to death....before I buy I over-research every boat, tent, pack, sleeping bag, etc....I currently own a 'Nigel Dennis' Greenlander Pro sea kayak, a 'Boreal Designs' Esperanto (Tandem kayak), and a 'Necky' Switch whitewater play boat (and I have owned probably a dozen other boats in the past).....I have paddles in all types of conditions on all kinds of water including the upper north Atlantic (Quebec,Labrador,Newfoundland), the Florida Keyes, southern California, Mexico (both sides), all of the Great Lakes, Rocky Mountain lakes, the Colorado, the Ottawa, the Salmon, the Snake, the Gatineau and many, many many other rivers throughout North America....
When I began researching this particular boat it didn't take long to realize that this was the best boat for what I intended to use it for and at a great price.....The first time it saw the water was in Mexico just south of Play Del Carmen...I remeber when I first pushed off the beach in the calm waters of the bay I couldn't believe how impressed I was with how well it sat in the water, how stable it was and how light it felt on top of the water.....I took it out into the open ocean it it felt just as good as I ripped through some small white caps....We bought the boat for travelling abroad as I cannot take my rigid plastic and glass boats on the plane....I have have some amazing times in this boat and have even had all four of my boys along with me in the boat....This boat is a real beauty it makes every trip and adventure that much better...the set up/ take down time is minimal, and so what if it takes some time to dry out...IT IS AFTER ALL AN INFLATEABLE!!!
I have every accessory for this baby (****the stabilizer bar - bow to front is a must!)....
If you have any experience as a paddler you will agree that this boat paddles as good or better then most entry level to mid range rigid plastic boats....take the time to learn how to set the boat up properly, learn to paddle and this boat will give you many many years of adventure in places that you wouldn't typicallly see without an inflateable...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The boat is exactly as it is billed - Stable, portable, easy to manage Kayak with definite versatitity.
If you are considering buying one of these; let me dispell some negative comments by prior reviewers below.
It easily fits i the bag it comes with; take out the floor before you roll it up and pack the two separately.
It is very stable with the backbone. When I take it out solo (6'4"" 200lb) I experience very, very little sag in the middle - maybe a half inch.
Tough to get dirt out and get the floor dry. I will preface this comment by stating the obvious - Having recreational equipment of any kind means signing up for maintenance - whether it's hiking boots, backpacks, mountain bikes etc. This boat is no different. When you are done with a trip you have to do some maintenance - dry it out (wipe it out quickly is best)and hang it up in your garage for a day. Make sure it's completely dry before you put it back in the bag. 15-20min max of maintenance after your trip.
Not enough storage - If you are going single; not true; plenty if you know how to pack. If two are going on extended day trip; maybe - depending on the elments you will be facing.
Too small for tall guys - I'm 6'4"" - no problem at all.
Too heavy - It's 50ish lbs; that's what the package says - If you are wondering how heavy 50lbs is - next time you're at the gym.....
Takes forever to get set up an broken down. Plan on 30min in your garage when you first get it. Go step by step through the directions. Once you set it up the first time in the garage it will be a snap out of your car. 10min max prep on site; less than 5 breaking down - unless you wipe out on the spot - then plan on 10-15min.
Only conflict to watch for when you install the backbone is that instructions with the boat conflict with the instructions that come with the backbone as to when to put in the floor bottom and inflation timing. Make sure to put the floor bottom in deflated on top of the backbone then inflate the floor last.
Also; instructions say to not use a motorized pump; I have every time I've used it near my truck and have had no issues. I back off fully inflating certains parts based on the instructions guidance.
In summary; great boat for just about any water or event. Very stable. Easy to set up, take down, get in and out etc. Paddles well. Gives you nice flexibility because of it's size when broken down.
I will be strapping the boat to an exterior frame backpack next summer to go even more remote for a starting point. Probably not for everyone given the weight...to me 75lbs on my back is not a big deal and this boat will handle most recreational kayakers will want to get themselves into....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Was originally looking at a Sevylor, but dropped into REI on the way just to look at the Advanced Elements boat. After looking at both and having read reviews we coughed up the extra wonga and went with the AE. Also the REI store and canoe staff were just so much nicer!
What we wanted: An inflatable kayak, as we will be returning to the UK soon where we have a small house and a small car. A hardshell would be expensive to ship home and inconvenient to our circumstances. We are fair weather novice paddlers with 2 small children (5 & 3) so we wanted something with a bit of room and above all stable. All in with paddles, a pump, PFDs and some non essential goodies the whole package was well within budget, and less than the cost of a similar sized hardshell alone.
Setting up: The packed canoe is easy to lift and carry. The instructions are clear. Be aware that the AE official pump does not fit the fancy military style twist valves. The AE sanctioned work around until they get the correct fittings is to wrap a piece of electrical tape around the pump nozzle so that it makes a tight seal. This is the only apparent evidence of poor design or at least 'not joined up thinking' about the kayak. Unpacking and inflation takes under 10 minutes (probably far less after a little experience). 50 pumps each into the main chambers, 15 into the floor and 2 each for the bow deck lifters. There is also a thwart / foot rest that we didn't use due to lack of space. Seats fit easily and you're ready to go.
On the water: Getting in was easy, the boat is exceedingly stable. 2 Adults and 2 small boys is a squeeze, but it isn't what it's really designed for. Tracking and speed seemed perfectly adequate, though given our lack of experience and with 2 small boys sticking various appendages into the water it's kind of hard to tell. Did I mention that the boat is very stable?
The missus found getting out to be a bit of a challenge as the boat is very low in the water, but again the intrinsic stability forgave clumsy movements.
The boat is pretty comfortable. It is easy to pick out of the water and to carry short distances for portage. However it will bend in the middle if you load it with gear whilst being carried.
Breaking down: Very easy, 5 minutes. We didn't completely deflate and pack away, just opened the valves and threw it in the back of the van loosely folded.
Drying out: You do need space to lay the canoe out so that it can dry, before packing away properly. It does fold up into the original bag with a little effort, but they could of made the bag just a little bigger. The missus now has a project to construct a bigger bag with a complete side panel zipper.
Would I recommend to a friend? Yes, definitely if they were looking for an inflatable. We will be buying a second boat so that we can do longer trips without overcrowding. Might even invest in the deck skirts as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This boat is so awesome, I had to share. I have had mine for about five years now, and it has held up great. Fits in my Jeep or my camper, goes anywhere and so easy to deploy. I suggest getting the additional ""backbone"" piece for it, adding both rigidity and forming a more distinct keel to aid in tracking. I am about 240lbs, and I can use it alone or with another adult, no problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My wife and I are both new to kayaking so we did lots of research last fall before deciding on the AF convertible and are completely satisfied with our decision. We also purchased the optional 2 person deck.
Usage: Our usage the kayak is recreational - day trips in calm lakes and smaller/calm rivers with only mild current. We've already been in shallow water in an upstream river (about a 1 foot of water) and the kayak performed very well. We do keep our eyes open for underwater obstacles when we are in low water.
Size/Storage: My wife is 5'and I'm 5'7"" so we fit inside with no problems. We also have a good amount of room left for cargo bags which is great since we tend to over-pack a little for day trips. We have a 10L deck bag on the front deck under the lash cords, an 8L dry bag under front deck at my wife's feet. There is room for another 8L bag at my feet if we don't use the thwart (which we haven't so far). We also keep a foot pump behind the rear seat in the event we need some extra air in the middle of a trip.
Performance/Comfort: Stability of the boat is incredible. We have no feeling of tipping at all. The boat tracks well and paddles very easily. I do most of the paddling work from the rear seat and my wife adds where she can. We tend to avoid windy conditions but I've been able to handle a little wind with a little extra effort too. Comfort is also incredible. My wife has some back problems so were a little concerned about that but everything has been fine there too.
Setup: After setting it a couple times the process becomes very easy. We use a small rechargeable pump to get the bigger chambers inflated 1/2 to 3/4 way up then top off with the hand pump. The rechargeable pump really helps out and saves time and effort.
Normally we look for a grassy area near the launch to setup. We have a tarp in the car in case a site has nothing but dirt but so far we've always been able to find a grass area. If there is a distance to the put-in I have found that I can carry the inflated kayak myself by unzipping the deck to gain access to the far side. I pull the kayak up on to my shoulder (resting the big gray tube on my shoulder) and it's pretty easy to just walk around with it. The whole setup process takes about 10 minutes.
Break-down: Deflation is easy too. I use the hand pump in deflate mode to suck out any remaining air. We pull out the floor and wipe down inside with a towel. Then we fold and wipe/dry each section of the underside.
We've decided not to put the kayak into the bag. I know it can be done but for us it's just easier/faster to wrap the folded kayak with 2 adjustable fabric straps (the general tie-down straps with adjustable slider). This method makes it very easy to carry the folded kayak and load into trunk too by grabbing the 2 straps like a handle. It might help to air things out a little too with this outside the bag method. We do use the bag to carry all of the accessory parts - the deck, the seats, the floor, the pumps etc. The whole break-down process is also about 10 minutes.
Summary: The only small modification we have done is to add a few bungee cords across the rear deck tying them to the 4 D rings that came attached to the deck there. It helps to hold down a small item similar to the front deck elastic cords.
Overall we are thrilled with the kayak and are having so much fun. All the materials are heavy duty quality and the boat is great looking on the water. Many people ask questions about it while we are setting it up or breaking down. Great job Advanced Elements, thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"If you don't have a place to store a rigid kayak and don't like the idea of driving with one on the top of your car, this is perfect. It only takes 5 minutes to set up and take down once you do it a few times. Goes in a trunk or the back of our Escape handily. A bit heavy for one person to carry very far in the bag, but do-able if you can park near the water. I can attest that you can feel rocks when your rear end encounters them, but the hull seems very durable - the only marks left are light scratches on the molded-in keel. My son and I paddled for four hours and it behaved well in Lake Michigan chop and backwaters alike. The only water inside was from the paddles. I'd advise you to get the backbone, which makes it flex less in choppy waves and keeps you sitting higher when paddling solo. We fold it up after an outing and take it home or back to the cottage minus the bag, then hose it off and wipe it down before letting it dry in the sun. A micfofiber cloth works well for drying it and getting the dirt off surfaces. I worried that the bare vinyl floor might be vulnerable to wear and tear from shoes, sand, and mud, but it's very tough stuff. The outer hull surface is extremely tough. This boat looks nice, paddles easily, and overall is loads of fun. I might not tackle rapids in it, or take it on the ocean, but then again I wouldn't be likely to do that in any kayak myself. It seems to hold its own next to any comparable plastic kayak on lakes (including Lake Michigan in a stiff breeze) and in moderate river currents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"We took the kayak out for the first time today and loved it. It took about a half hour to set up, mostly because we had to consult the instructions several times. We were warned that inflatables are less responsive than hard-shells but we did fine on the lake. It felt sturdy and best of all, lightweight to move and carry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This kayak is amazing. A friend of mine has had hers for 5+ years and when I moved to a Lake community last year, I decided to get mine based on how well hers has held up over the years. It’s easy to inflate and, if you read the directions and follow their folds, packing it up is easy too (just bring some towels to ensure it’s dry!) While nothing is guaranteed, it would take an act of God to tip this thing over. I have spilled an entire beer in it and practically stood up to dry it up (I don’t recommend this) and it’s perfectly stable. I also suggest a shorter PFD as the long ones will ride up and choke you when you sit down. This kayak is completely manageable for one person to handle if you can lift 50lbs. Great handles allow you to pick it up and put it down if you need a break walking with it. I recommend the double action pump with the psi pressure gauge to ensure you are blowing it up properly. I can’t recommend this kayak enough. Starting my second summer with it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"For this product to work, you have to buy additional accessories that almost double the cost. We are taking it back and just getting a normal one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"We keep this on our sailboat.
Easy for one person to take on and off. I love the conversion from 2 person to 1 person.
Durable, maneuvarble, fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I maybe jaded from hard side kayaks, but this takes forever to pump up, it misaligns and you spend half the day trying to get it on track, it was heavy to transport, doesn't go back in bag, I bought the backbone, hard floor, electric pump, the whole deal. too much to deal with, just buy a hard side top water, same price better performance and time on the water, and it will last way way longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My wife and I bought this boat in July to take on our bi-annual trips to Belize, since it was compact and at 58 lbs light enough to use as a checked piece of luggage. We were amazed with the ease of set up and inflation (you buy a pump separately) the very first time we used it on a local class 2 river and have only been more impressed each time we use it. So far it has been used both Solo and Tandem on lakes and rivers up to class 2. We have toured,fly fished and used it as a swim platform (We hope to use it as a Dive platform this next May in Belize). Because of it's low profile in the water, wind does not bother this boat any more than my rigid kayak and less so than our canoe. Set up time is no more than 20 minutes from the trunk to the water. While it does take a little longer to deflate and dry ( we take a towel along to dry the inside )it fits easily back into the duffel bag in about 25 minutes. We purchased the tandem spray deck for it and it significantly increases it's rigidity and reduces the amount of water that gets inside. The only improvement I would suggest is to add more colors preferably an earth tone one so you could use it for Hunting as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I bought this product for very spicific reasons. I wanted something easy to transport, relatively light, inexpensive, and large enough for myself and my two Portuguese Water Dogs. The kayak is easy and quick to blow up and set up. It is very roomy for myself, my stuff and my two dogs. It is very stable and easy to paddle in lakes. I put towels on the floor for the dogs to walk and lie on. It is very easy for dogs to jump off of into the water and to re-board the boat with help as it sits low in the water. My three complaints that seem to be the same for every other owner are: 1) It is very time comsuming to dry. It is best to towel dry, fold and stuff as best as possible into bag in order to dry later. 2) It is difficult if not impossible to re-pack into the bag. 3) The seats are very uncomfortable as they offer no support and slip around a lot. This is exacerbated by the lack of foot braces. The seats buckle in instead of using a clip. I am figuring out a way to add clips so that I can buy one good seat. Nothing worse than a fatigued back!
My dogs and I had a great time on the lake and I would recommend this boat for someone that wants lots of room for a family or dogs. It is easy for one person to manage although you need another person to carry to launch area if you can't inflate on site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Wow! My wife and I have been out a couple of times and really enjoyed the kayak. I have been researching kayak's for a couple of years by reading articles, renting, and talking to other kayakers. This is definitely the best way to go, although their are some trade-offs between the conventional kayak and this inflatable. It is not as maneuverable, but it is quick and easy to store. Maintenance is more time consuming as opposed to a conventional craft,but it is quick to throw in the truck and go. It takes about 15 minutes to inflate and set up for the day, but it is not tied to the roof, which is difficult to load and unload.
We went out of Dana Point this past Saturday and launched from the beach at the North end of the harbor. We went out to the Reef and rocks off the point and it was absolutely incredible. We kayaked with dolphins and sea lions and the round trip took a little over two hours. What made this really incredible is how low you sit and paddle in this craft. A lot lower than a sit-on ocean kayak. It gives a whole different experience. It is almost like sitting in the water. A very unique perspective when looking out across the ocean surface.
Clean-up was a time comittment of an hour and a half, but what of it. The kayak is now stored in the garage and ready for next Saturday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My wife and I were looking for a small inflatable boat to enjoy the lakes and rivers when camping over the weekend in the Hill Country. A lot of research led us to REI and Advanced Elements. We have had it for 3 years now and have used it countless times. Has enough space for the 2 of us, our little shihtzu, and small cooler. It is best for downstream class 1 and 2, a lot of fun when the two of us learned to make sharp turns!!! It is not easy at first, but once you get the kayak stiff enough (you gotta pump the side chambers hard) and the person on the back of the kayak uses the paddle as a tiler while the other in the front paddles hard, turning on white water is fairly easy and fun! Bumping rocks is inevitable but a breeze, not damage whatsoever. We only capsized once because we hit a log on the side, the kayak is very stable! On lakes and bays it takes more effort to paddle, the wind can affect directing the boat straight... Last winter we bought the deck extension and the skirts, they work great as well and kept us warm. You really need to leave it open for a couple of days to get it completely dry for storage. I don't agree that the bag is small as others have said, if you pump the air out with the pump in reverse there is plenty of space. For the price and versatility it is hard to beat this one!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I HAVE A BUICK PARK AVENUE FOR WHICH ROOF TOP CARRIERS AREN'T AVAILABLE. WHEN MY WIFE AND I WANTED TO BUY EITHER A CANOE OR A KAYAK, WE DECIDED TO GO INFLATABLE AND SKIP THE RACK SEARCH. GOOD IDEA! AFTER A FEW TRIPS TO LOCAL LAKES, WE TOOK OUR TANDEM TO GLACIER N.P. AND HAD A WONDERFUL OUTING ON LAKE MACDONALD. 15 MINUTES OF SET-UP WITH A BATTERY POWERED COLEMAN AIR PUMP DID MOST OF THE JOB, TOPPED OFF BY A FEW STROKES FROM A 2-WAY HAND PUMP WE BOUGHT WITH THE BOAT. IT COULD NOT BE EASIER, EVEN FOR A NUCLEAR MED TECH LIKE ME!! BACK IN ITS CASE, BACK IN THE TRUNK AND A SMOOTH 6 HOUR DRIVE BACK TO COLVILLE IN MY BIG BUICK AND I'M A HAPPY MAN. BUY THIS BOAT!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. WE MAY BUY A CANOE FOR LOCAL RUNS, USING MY WIFE'S FORD FOR CARRYING IT, BUT THE KAYAK REMAINS OUR LONG DISTANCE TRAVELING COMPANION. NICE JOB, ADVANCED ELEMENTS!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
