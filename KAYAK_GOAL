I've begun working on my web scraping project and am looking to touch base with the mentor network about my project. I don't have any questions really, but am looking for feedback on my project topic and advice about the project going forward. A little background on my project: I've decided to web scrape kayak product pages for product info and reviews. Kayaks vary considerably in design and what seems like a small change can drastically change how a kayak performs in different conditions. Even though a single kayak can be used in different settings (for example, whitewater kayaking versus open lake kayaking), different designs perform better in different settings. Performance here means speed, stability, and maneuverability. The goal of my project is to analyze the different technical specifications (dimensions, materials, tracking system, and advertised primary use (flatwater, whitewater, racing, sea, etc.)) and see how reviews compare. Hypothetically I would like to see what combination of features are the most popular, and how ratings vary by design choices. At this point, any advice on how to analyze the review portion would be appreciated. At the moment I am considering sentiment analysis.
