# kayak_scraper
This project scrapes REI kayak product pages for product info and reviews. Kayaks vary considerably in design and what seems like a small change can drastically change how a kayak performs in different conditions. Even though a single kayak can be used in different settings (for example, whitewater kayaking versus open lake kayaking), different designs perform better in different settings. Performance here means speed, stability, and maneuverability. The goal of my project is to analyze the different technical specifications (dimensions, ratings, price, and advertised primary use (flatwater, whitewater, racing, sea, etc.)) and see how reviews compare.
